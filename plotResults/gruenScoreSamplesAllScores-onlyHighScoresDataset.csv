One day she saw two dancing sows that a shepherd had obtained from a little gray man. To get one of these pigs -- for the dancing sows finally made her happy -- she had shown the shepherd her birthmark, namely a golden hair on her right breast. Now she declared that she would marry whatever man could guess her birthmark, then herd three hundred hares, and finally say something true that no one else knew about. Our shepherd already knew about her birthmark, so he volunteered to herd the three hundred hares. They were counted out to him, but he had scarcely gone into the open with them when they all scampered away from him. However, the little gray man gave him a flute, and when he blew into it every last one of the hares came running back to him. Now first the nobleman's daughter, then her mother, and finally her father -- all in disguise -- came to the shepherd to beg a hare from him. And each got one for a very high price, but when the shepherd blew into his flute the hares broke loose and ran back to him. Thus only the third task remained. The suitors were all invited to a gathering, but none of them, however noble they all were, was able to tell an unknown truth. Finally the shepherd rose from his seat in the back of the hall and began to relate what price he had received for the sale of the hares. This was all terribly embarrassing for the noble maiden and her parents, so they finally declared the shepherd the winner, and he married the nobleman's daughter.",0.7890406219022614,0.7890406219022614,0.0,0.0

He had reached a spot known as the Thieves' Hole, and, as he slowly rode along thinking of the profitable bargain which he hoped to make, was startled by the sudden appearance of an old man, tall and strangely clad in a deep flowing garment. The old man ordered him to stop, told him that he knew the errand upon which the rider was bent, and offered a sum of money for the horse. The farmer, however, refused the offer, not thinking it sufficient. ""Go, then, to Macclesfield,"" said the old man, ""but mark my words, you will not sell the horse. Should you find my words come true, meet me this evening, and I will buy your horse. "" The farmer laughed at such a prophecy, and went on his way.

Checking his pace, he began to consider how far it might be prudent to deal with a perfect stranger in so lonely a place. However, while he was considering what to do, the old man commanded him, ""Follow me!"" Silently the old man led him by the Seven Firs, the Golden Stone, by Stormy Point, and Saddle Boll.

The jackal saw the monkeys and became very sad. He had been driven away by the monkeys' cry. ""Oh, very sorry,"" said the jackal. ""But you must follow us, because only jackals go into the Brahman's banquet. "" So the jackal and his companion went out. When they came to the Brahman's courtyard, the jackal pulled away from the others' necks all the fruit and all the cakes, taking only the one which was empty. Then he went into the Brahman's house and looked for a place to lie down. Since the jackal was only a jackal and not a king, he did not have any clothes, and so went out through the keyhole. The others, however, who were watching the courtyard, saw where he was going, and shouted, ""Jackal, Jackal! We are beginning to think that you are a king.

""You should make your friend the jackal king, and then you might win!"" ""But how can I win the jackal's favour?"" ""Just pretend that you are a king in your own image, and the jackal will become your slave. "" So the jackal did what he had been ordered to do. He cried, ""Jahsh, jahsh, I am a king,"" and so issued forthwith a jackal, who became the king of the jachin. From that time he was respected and even feared. Many men married jackals, and became king's slaves. The men were very happy, because they were far too wise to use force in their dealings with other men. They were also careless, considering that they knew nothing about men. It so happened that a poor man had one day brought a jackal wife to the marriage. When his day as a bride was nearing an end, and he was about to set off to another land, he said to his wife, ""Should anything happen to you, feel sure that I will take the jackal as a bride for myself.

The jackal was very pleased with the gift he had received, and told his master that he would do just as he would with the treasure. So Fortunio put on the skin, and said to himself, ""Now I can rest and not have to make any decisions for myself.

But the jackal, having realized that he had been deceptively introduced into the city, decided to return to the forest, or to goad himself and his friends into a battle which would determine the fate of the city.

So they kept hurrying up the road, but they were not allowed to leave their hole till they had covered the distance in a single night. Then they feared that the jackals would leave their troop in a body, and seek out their protection in the foliage.

When the man had received and taken home the naked bosom, and had begun to prepare a feast for the two of them, the fairy stood before him and inquired whether he had seen any one before, and when the man replied that he had, the fairy added, ""Then, I am entirely safe from your suspicion.

Many a time, and especially after meals, he related to his son and his grandson his brave deeds while serving in the king's army, the responsible positions he filled after leaving a soldier's life; and he told entertaining stories of hundreds of years gone by. The father was not satisfied with the arrangement, however, and planned to get rid of the old man. One day he let his feet go out from under the cabin door, and the son had to drag his own father to the door. When the old man came to the door, the son told him how the old man had once been terribly hungry, but for some reason he had never once thought of eating a man. This very meal proved to be a changeling. The old man, thinking that it was a he, pecked at it and ate it up. For a long time no willing person could be found, but finally a woman came to the door with a chicken bone.

""We will dig up my dead husband and hang him on the gallows in the place of the stolen corpse. "" With the rat's help the Osaka rat dug up the grave, and then the rats began to feast and drink wine. They had not eaten dinner for some time when a servant arrived to collect the leftovers, and the swollen rat, still carrying the pot, ran out of the house. The next morning the servant boy met with the old servant girl, who reported that the rats had eaten everything and that the only thing remaining were the bones of dead birds. She also had seen the Osaka rat carrying away the platter. The girl went back home and took along the necessary tools and began working very hard. The workbench told her how well they had come together, and she had made a good pair. The next morning she went to the assembly of the Osaka rats and told them how they had helped her, and how the rat king had congratulated her on her work.

The rat king had no sooner said ""Who is going to marry me?"" than the bride's hand shot out of her mouth. No sooner had she done this, than the king awoke and was about to depart.

And what followed was quite as bad as it sounded. The king, due to his love for the maiden, had never before owned a dog. Now, both before and after his death, the rat returned every day to his master's room and wiggled his paws throughout the night. The king, who grew ever more perplexed as time went by, met with the same fate every time. He finally concluded that neither the rat nor the eagle could be removed from the castle, and he remained unhappily at home. To accent the changeling's cries, he placed a wooden whistle in his bed. The next night the wooden whistle boomed, and the rat climbed into the bed with the dog tied around its tail. When the god heard this, he came into the room and demanded vengeance. The rat replied that he would give his life to atone for his deeds. Scarcely had he said this, than the emperor bade one of his guards hand him up a plowshare and give him the plowshare to hold in his teeth. Such was the emperor's amazement that day, that he took along a servant girl and hurried to the castle. However, as he came near the gate, he heard the rat crying. He did what he had been asked, and pulled the girl up onto the workbench. However, she was still alive, and her fiancée had died. Deathly ill, he was brought before the emperor, and he asked him why he had rescued the rat and not his wife. The emperor knew that the girl had been his wife, and when he heard the answer he became angry and led him away. The girl myself had the same question, and he commanded Death to take her away and spare the rat, and that both she and the rat should live. On Death's answer the rat approched, and he ran along that way until he came to a pond. He dived into the water, and was soon followed by Death. When he was about to return, the emperor heard the rat crying. He went into the pond and asked the rat what it was that he had done. The rat told him, and the emperor liked what he heard. And when he heard that the rat was well and thriving, he spared the rat and gave it a palace and plenty of food, and said, ""Not only you, but also that other rat, whom I had the misfortune to kill, was injured by that rat. So I will help you out of your trouble. "" Then the rat took the emperor to his palace, and complained of the rat's loss of life. But the emperor smiled and said, ""There's no getting around it. You were injured by that rat, and she was the one who caused your misfortune. I will help you out of it, and will make up for the loss of life.

Therefore did he leave them in their old age, when they were deemed fit to die, but without allowing them to benefit by the protection of a fixed elder tree, which they had sought to have cut down, but which he had hidden from them. This tree bore the same fruit as the other trees, but when it was cut down it gave forth a terrible shriek, and then died. This happened at the age of 115. A peasant, who was a master in the black art, was ordered to carry the corpse of the murdered man to the place of execution, and to bind his soul to the tree. This was done, and the body was carried to the place of execution. The horrible deed having been done, they laid the poor unfortunate man in the coffin, and nailed up the coffin and the grave.

The compound ""nightmårt"" is also very common. The forms ""mår"" (masculine) and ""måre"" (feminine) also exist. The designation ""alp"" is recognized as well. All of these names are used to designate the spirit being that sits upon a sleeping person's chest, thus depriving him of motion and speech.

The mårt can be captured by grasping it with an inherited glove or by closing up all of the room's openings as soon as the sleeping person begins to groan. Mårt-pressure (also called a mårt-ride) can be prevented by crossing one's arms and legs before falling asleep.

Hereupon Adam told them to take their offerings to Allah, thereby referring the dispute to His determination.

The only description I can give you of it is, a very thin, bell-mouthed, beaker glass, deep and narrow, ornamented on the outside with fancy work of coloured glass, and may hold something more than a pint. Antient superstition may have contributed not a little to its preservation; but that it should not, in a more enlightened age, or in moments of conviviality (see the Ballad), meet with one gentle rap (and a gentle one would be quite sufficient for an ordinary glass of the same substance), is to me somewhat wonderful. Superstition, however, cannot be entirely eradicated from the mind at once. The late agent of the family had such a reverential regard for this glass, that he would not suffer any person to touch it, and but few to see it . When the family, or other curious people, had a desire to drink out of it, a napkin was held underneath, less any accident should befall it; and it is still carefully preserved in a case made on purpose. The case is said to be the second, yet bears the marks of antiquity, and is charged with ihs . Tradition, our only guide here, says, that a party of Fairies were drinking and making merry round a well near the Hall, called St. Cuthbert's well; but, being interrupted by the intrusion of some curious people, they were frightened, and made a hasty retreat, and left the cup in question: one of the last screaming out, If this cup should break or fall, Farewell the Luck of Edenhall.",0.6653747344567139,0.6653747344567139,0.0,0.0

After the mortal had been confined with him, his hand was removed from the well by a messenger from the government. The young man, who had only a single lock of hair on his right hand, was supposed by the minister to be the messenger. The minister commanded him to return the finger to the well with the face downwards facing the opposite bank. The young man did so, and after having done so a terrible flood was caused to sweep away much of the country garden. The young man was tried by a jury of twelve men and women, who were all supposed to have been present at the advent of the messenger. He was condemned to be thrown to the lions in the amphitheater, but though anxious consultation was had as to the number to be committed to the lions, it was not decided which of them should strike first. The decision was soon made that the turtle, from whose fingers the finger had been taken, should first be cast to the lions, but not much of a fight was it, for the turtles returned and put the finger back. The lions then turned their attention to the turtle, but luck was not with him. The turtle picked up the stone, and with his thorn-club struck the lion on the back of the head. Then the turtle crawled into the lion's hole and with his nest prepared for the arrival of the king. The king, who had just arrived, turned his steps towards the Turtle's Pelt, which had just gone to the end of the long row.

samples-17500,"Of the Two Milling Places in Otway's Kead Castle, Dunvegan. The two words, ""Two mill,"" are used in reference to two places where one person or family was usually employed at some harvest time. It is generally applied to millers, but it could be anyone who had something to spare for trough or trough of bread, or wax, or bluemoss (bs. cubley) , etc. , and who did not bring his chatties (which were kept cold at night) fully charged. It was the custom to throw the chatties out with the other grain, in order that some rainy season might cease. One of the most curious thefts ascribed to it was that of the bluemoss, a species of willow, which is used in the dyeing of the native trees. It is related of one of these workers, who was known as ""Old Nick,"" that he was returning home one evening,, the weather being very rainy. It was dark, and he found a piece of bluemoss near the door, which had run out in patches during the severe storms of the past few days. Will he touch it? He did not know. Had he done so, he would have had an opportunity to change it. He went to a nearby peasant who had a green finger, and who used it for twig-drying. He told him the story, and the peasant, who apparently took it for true, was sentenced to death. It is added that the finger was part of a clothing stock, and that it came under the direction of the authorities. oThere is one thing remarkable in relation to this mill, which may be mentioned in connection with a story of another nature. It is, that when the mill was in its active infancy, a young man by the name of J. O'Grady, who was engaged in grinding corn, drew the attention of the mill by suddenly appearing before it, and insisting on being allowed to assist. The miller threatened to have the young man turned away, if he did not leave. The truth of the matter was, that the young man had been lifted up by a magic power, and kept sitting where he was. Some people doubted or ignored this story. oThat it could be true is attested by the fact that if the miller now went to where he had seen the boy, he would not believe it. But if he did so, he would loose his ""old friend,"" and on account of it should lose his life. The miller, who was a kind neighbor, sent a miller's clerk to bring the old man home, and told him to keep the clerk informed of what he should do; and the clerk, after going a walk about the village, went back to the mill. While mending some rods in the mill the mill swung round and crushed the boy's head. He drowned immediately afterwards, and remains in a grave in the mill, which has a curious legend connected with it. It is said that a team of horses was putting water in the mill, when it struck the block of gold. The mill is still there, and is still shown at Dunvegan Castle, on the mountain road, where a wagon route begins at the mill.

The farmer, much perplexed, went to the minister for advice, who scoffed at the idea of any supernatural connection with the children's story, ridiculed the existence of ""Good People,"" and would not allow the coffin to be opened. The matter was therefore allowed to rest. But, some little time after, the minister, who had gone to Lochgilphead for the day, was found lying dead near the Fairies' Hill, a victim, many people thought, to the indignation of the Fairy world he had laughed at.",0.698556844145248,0.798556844145248,-0.1,0.0

He had a good friend, the wolf, and he crept out in the evening into the forest to him, and complained of the fate that awaited him. ""Listen, kinsman,"" said the wolf, ""be of good cheer. I will help you out of your trouble. I have thought of something. Tomorrow, early in the morning, your master is going with his wife to make hay, and they will take their little child with them, for no one will be left behind in the house. While they are at work they lay the child behind the hedge in the shade. You lie down there too, just as if you wanted to guard it. Then I will come out of the woods, and carry off the child. You must run swiftly after me, as if you would take it back to its parents, who will think that you have rescued it, and will be far too grateful to do you any harm. On the contrary, you will be treated royally, and they will never let you want for anything again. "" This idea pleased the dog, and it was carried out just as planned.

You shall eat free bread as long as you live. "" And to his wife he said, ""Go home at once and make Old Sultan some bread soup that he will not have to bite. And bring the pillow from my bed.

""But, kinsman,"" he said, ""you will just close one eye if, when I have a chance, I carry off one of your master's fat sheep. "" ""Don't count on that,"" answered the dog. ""I will remain true to my master. I cannot agree to that. "" The wolf thought that this was not spoken in earnest, and he crept up in the night to take away the sheep. But the farmer, to whom the faithful Sultan had told the wolf's plan, was waiting for him and combed his hair cruelly with a flail.

The wolf and his friend were already at the appointed place, but when they saw their enemy coming, they thought that he was bringing a saber with him, for they mistook the cat's outstretched tail for one. And when the poor animal hopped on three legs, they thought that each time it was picking up a stone to throw at them. Then they took fright. The wild boar crept into the underbrush and the wolf jumped up a tree. As the dog and the cat approached, they wondered why no one was to be seen. The wild boar, however, had not been able to hide himself completely in the leaves. His ears were still sticking out. While the cat was looking cautiously about, the boar wiggled his ears, and the cat, who thought it was a mouse, jumped on it and bit down hard.

The foes of war were soon replaced by the enemies cold, thirst, and hunger. With nowhere to turn for help, he was about to surrender to the powers of despair, when without warning an awful spirit appeared before him. He offered the poor soldier great wealth, if he would but serve this uncanny master for as long as he should live. St. Ives, the nearest market town, was nearly distant. The soldier knew that only a few years ago this forest had been the scene of a vast crop of pea fields. The harvesters had known this to earth, but however much they wished to learn the reason of this misfortune, they were told that it was because the German soldier, as a werewolf, had been inside the mill during the night, and had tormented the grain children by pouring boiling oil over their children. The soldier refused to carry out this agreement, and left the cloister. Agnes, only half heard the voice saying these words, but she looked into the small church next to the house and there she saw a great abyss, down which hung a hung man, hideous and distorted, and only half-alive. She could not move him, and knew not who he was. The soldier told her to fear not, that he would soon return, and tell her the reason of his disappearance. This did not help, as she continued to wander about the forest. However, on the third day she was approached by a shepherd, who wished her to follow him. He said that he had left his home, and that he would tell her where he had gone if she would accompany him to his horse stall. She accompanied him, and through the open door she could see neither heaven nor earth. Everything was strange to her. The stallion stood in a pitiful state, and she saw him looking out of the window. She could not stand to see him like this, and she had to force him to drink out of a horse's-box. The shepherd was a famous horseman, and all the other horsemen wanted to be his wife. Now first of all they wanted to kill him, but they knew of no one who was so bold as to take on a woman. So they called their horses to come and help him.

Thinking thus to deceive the peasant, they placed the dough in the ashes and lay down to sleep. But the peasant saw through their trick, arose and ate the loaf when it was half baked, and lay down again. Then one of the burghers, as though frightened by his dream, awoke and called the other.

God was ""nigh unto his faithful servant,"" and when the first stage was completed he caused a present of sweetmeats to be laid before the travelers. As the Jew and the Christian had already eaten their evening meal when the sweetmeats arrived, they proposed to lay them aside till the morrow; but the Muslim, who was keeping fast, and therefore could not eat before nightfall, proposed to eat them that night. To this the other two refused to consent, alleging that the Muslim wanted to eat the whole of the sweetmeats himself. Then the Muslim proposed to divide them into three portions, so that each might eat his own portion when he pleased; but this also was objected to by the others, who quoted the proverb, ""The divider is in hell. "" The Muslim explained to them that this proverb meant the man who divides his allegiance between God and lust; but they still refused to give way, and the Muslim therefore submitted, and lay down to sleep in the endurance of the pangs of hunger. Next morning, when they awoke, it was agreed between them that each should relate his dreams, and that the sweetmeats should be awarded to him whose dream was the best. The Jew said that he had dreamed that Moses had carried him to the top of Mount Sinai, and shown him marvelous visions of the glory of heaven and the angels. The Christian said he had dreamed that Jesus had carried him up to the fourth heaven and shown him all the glories of the heavens. Finally the Muslim said that the Prophet Muhammad had appeared to him in person, and after commending him for his piety in saying his prayers and keeping fast so strictly on the previous night, had commanded him to eat up those divinely provided sweetmeats as a reward, and he had accordingly done so. The Jew and the Christian were at first annoyed with him for thus stealing a march upon them; but on his pointing out that he had no option but to obey the Prophet's commands, they admitted that he had done right, and that his dream was the best, as he had been awake, while they were asleep. The moral is, that the divine treasure is revealed as an immediate intuition to those who seek it with prayer and humble obedience, and not to those who seek to infer and deduce its nature",0.502490852638552,0.802490852638552,-0.2,-0.1

Adam replied, ""My foot is already under the coffin, and my heart is already in the grave. Let us put them together and make a strong lock.

And he replied, ""It was under the coffin when I was removed from it!"" And they ran to the coffin, opened it, and saw that his hand was broken and naked. Then Adam Eliezer went out, took a stick in his hand, and went to the inhabitants of the village and said, ""Let us kill these men and take their property, for they broke the word of God and their wife died as a consequence.

He complied, and at dinner he ate as rapidly as his wife could bake. When they had finished their meal, the shoemaker told his wife to carry the pan back to its owner. She refused, however, and declared that she did not like to carry back borrowed articles. As he insisted, they nearly came to blows, but finally they agreed to go to work, and the one who spoke first should return the pan to its owner. The shoemaker seated himself on his platform, sewing and handling his shoes and his leather. His wife took her seat by her spinning wheel, and soon they were working as if life depended upon their handiness. Neither uttered a sound. In a short time a squire who lived in the neighborhood, and who had given a pair of shoes to the shoemaker to repair, passed the house, bid his coachman stop, and sent his servant in, asking him to see whether his shoes were finished. The servant walked in, greeted, and delivered his errand. ""Whew, whe-ew, whe-e-e-e-e-ew!"" whistled the shoemaker, who sat on his three-legged chair, battling with the air, and sewing diligently. As the servant could not draw a single word from him by way of answer, he turned to the woman, whose spinning wheel went so rapidly that sparks flew from it. ""How is it,"" asked he, ""that your husband does not answer when I talk to him?""

The man whistles and the woman sings, and those are all the sounds they utter. They would not say as much as one plain word. "" The squire alighted to see what had happened to his traveling companion. ""If they pretend to make fun of their customers, I shall teach them manners,"" said he to himself. ""Here they are, and here I come. "" So he opened the door and walked in. The shoemaker whistled with all his might as soon as the squire opened his mouth to speak. The woman sang and shouted with all her might; but neither of them seemed to notice his question as to the shoes. At length he became vexed, seized his riding whip, and lifted it over the woman's shoulders. The shoemaker stole a glance at them, but said nothing. A minute later the whip was dancing lustily across the shoulder blades of the woman, who at once struck up a new tune, but less merry than before. But this was too much for the shoemaker.

During these hunts they almost always saw a wolf who -- even though he came within shooting distance -- could never be killed by a huntsman. Indeed, they even had to watch as he took a piece of game before their very eyes and -- something that was most remarkable to them -- ran with it into the village. Now once it happened that a hussar from Ludwigslust was traveling through the village and just happened to enter the house of a man named Feeg. When he entered the house a flock of children stormed out of the house with a loud cry and hurried out into the yard.

"" Now the merchant's wife thought, ""If I can get rid of the serpent, then I can buy more time, and then I can eat the sheep. "" With that plan she tried to get rid of the serpent, but in spite of her strength she was still overcome by anxiety, for she believed that it was her lover, and that without her knowledge he had been stealing sheep, and that before long he would possess her again. Then with one sweep of her hand she caught up a stone, and threw it into the well. Filled with regret, she ran to the house to see what had happened to her faithful dog, and to make sure that nothing unseemly had happened during his absence. But nothing had happened to him, but then her unexpected search had failed to reveal anything unseemly. With that her mother called upon her to be quick with the pudding, for her husband was just returning home, and if she left it till he returned, the Black One would again have his way with her.

But still, notwithstanding all this, he hid his misery very well, and turned himself into a wolf, and became the most powerful beast in the land. The people grew very weary of having so many idle and useless men and useless women, for they were cuckolded if they knew how many there were in the kingdom, and being neglected and squandered, they set themselves to die of hunger, and left themselves all to die. Now they had a wolf whom they set as a guard over the young cows, and many died of hunger; and he ate down the calves' bones, and what was left of their flesh was not meat, but giblet, and bones. When this was done, he went to the wolf, and, stealing a calf, turned it outstretched, and made a leap towards it. The wolf seized the child, and stood not saying good-bye to it, but threw it to the ground, and called Gölpe. When Gölpe got to the place where the children were standing, he saw that they were all terribly frightend, and said aloud, ""Good-bye, my children! I will come and get you all, and your mother too, when I am able to do so. "" And he began to get lire hardly, and to eat nothing but bread and water.

She listened to her hunger, she wanted to tear her apart, but then she remembered she had the Twig, and a pretty big lump of it came forth. She stepped out, and saw the twelve little girls, all dressed in red. They all had the same complexion, and dressed in the same way, came out together. But one of them was particularly beautiful, and for many a year she had been sitting there all alone, and no one had seen her. So she thought she would be different. She took the whip in her hand, and went to the market town where the other girls sold their wares. She came to the high street, and walked in at the door. She hid the Twig, and went out of the way.

But Gorlois refused to obey; upon which the king was highly incensed, and swore he would destroy his country, if he did not speedily compound for his offence. Accordingly, without delay, while their anger was hot against each other, the king got together a great army, and marched into Cornwall, the cities and towns whereof he set on fire. But Gorlois durst not engage with him, on account of the inferiority of his numbers; and thought it a wiser course to fortify his towns, till he could get succour from Ireland. And as he was under more concern for his wife than himself, he put her into the town of Tintagel, upon the seashore, which he looked upon as a place of great safety. But he himself entered the castle of Dimilioc, to prevent their being both at once involved in the same danger, if any should happen. The king, informed of this, went to the town where Gorlois was, which he besieged, and shut up all the avenues to it. A whole week was now past, when, retaining in mind his love to Igerna, he said to one of his confidants, named Ulfin de Ricaradoch: ""My passion for Igerna is such that I can neither have ease of mind, nor health of body, till I obtain her; and if you cannot assist me with your advice how to accomplish my desire, the inward torments I must suffer will kill me. "" ""Who can advise you in this matter,"" said Ulfin, ""when no force will enable us to have access to her in the town of Tintagel? For it is situated upon the sea, and on every side surrounded by it; and there is but one entrance into it, and that through a straight rock, which three men shall be able to defend against the whole power of the kingdom. Notwithstanding, if the prophet Merlin would in earnest set about this attempt, I am of opinion, you might with his advice obtain your wishes. "" The king readily believed what he was so well inclined to, and ordered Merlin, who was also come to the siege, to be called. Merlin, therefore, being introduced into the king's presence, was commanded to give his advice, how the king might accomplish his desire with respect to Igerna. And he, finding the great anguish of the king, was moved by such excessive love, and said, ""To accomplish your desire, you must make use of such arts as have not been heard of in your time. I know how, by the force of my medicines, to give you the exact likeness of Gorlois, so that in all respects you shall seem to be no other than himself. If you will therefore obey my prescriptions, I will metamorphize you into the true semblance of Gorlois, and Ulfin into Jordan of Tintagel, his familiar friend; and I myself, being transformed into another shape, will make the third in the adventure; and in this disguise you may go safely to the town where Igerna is, and have admittance to her. "" The king complied with the proposal, and acted with great caution in this affair; and when he had committed the care of the siege to his intimate friends, underwent the medical applications of Merlin, by whom he was transformed into the likeness of Gorlois, so that Ulfin was no longer a stain upon his hands, and that his hair was properly combed. Ulfin, however, had by this time received a sight of the king in the disguise of Gorlois, so that he returned into the town with great joy, and said to him, ""Your own eyes may convince you that I am not dead, but alive. But notwithstanding, the destruction of the town, and the slaughter of my men, is what very much grieves me; so that there is reason to fear the king's coming upon us, and taking us in this place.

Ever since then there have been terrible robbers who have tried to break into the house and steal the children. But the people there stayed steadfastly at war with them, victory after victory. Finally the foolish invaders thought, ""If we can just get into the house, we will be able to drive them away. "" Then they took a sharpened sabre and went into the house. They had not gone far when they saw the frightened child with the elves. The young woman already had a staff in her hand, and she fired at them. The first few flies fell dead, but the others ran in all directions and were killed by the weapons thrown by the deceived trolls. The mother looked on with pity as her children were drowned, and she whispered to the repentant elf, ""I take full responsibility for what I did. I will give you a place to lie down in. "" The elf complied, and lay down in the room where the children were lying. Then the mother told him what she had done. He immediately rose up and followed his advise.

The troll would come into the house, and then the farmer's wife had to drive him away. One day she went out in the field and bought a sharpened whistle. She put it into her mouth and blew it into the troll's face. The troll came in, and the farmer's wife had to go outside to meet some neighbors. As she went along, she met a troll she knew, and together they watched the bird and the cow. The troll came into the house, and the farmer's wife caught it, too, and beat it with a switch. But it continued to call out, ""Mother, mother, go slowly, I pray you; because I, too, am ready to die for my fairy mistress!"" And then the mother, trusting in her dear fairy, went even faster than she had come. Yet again she caught the troll, and this time she killed it. She buried it beneath the foundation of the house, and then she could begin her prayers. From that time forth the house was filled with fairies, as well as with small trolls, littormen, and imps. And ever after that the farmer's wife lived in fear of them, and all kinds of trolls, littormen, and imps came and begged her for money. She would give them something, and they would say, ""Woman, your stick is long and thin, and will never harm you; but we ourselves have wounds severe enough for any strength they may have.

Now it happened that Ucay had a mother who was very poor. One day she was sitting alone on the road, crying and mourning at the loss of her child. Next morning she was surprised to find a letter on her little table, from purpose to her friend, thanking her for her great kindness in requesting the return of the newspaper, and promising that on a certain date she should get it back to her. On this date it happened that there was a fair in the city, and the bride found herself going to the palace to offer herself for their party. When she found herself near the gate to the palace she took a knife, cut off one of her breasts, and out of it made a song, with her very best music, until the chamberlain went to the door and heard it. Then he went in, and found the young lady very sad, and said to her, ""What shall I do to you, dear?"" ""Sire, heed my voice,"" said she; ""and as you shall sing all night, so he shall see that you are not alone, and that you are not dead. "" So the king commanded her to sing, and the song went on for many happy moments, until it grew late, but without seeing any sign of the health of the young couple. When just on the point of returning, they beheld a pile of golden florins, well as she had been accustomed; and what was the astonishment of the guest to observe that on the last goodeel of the smith's house, was carefully preserved in a jar. The king's son, Vincenti, who was of an extremely avaricious disposition, finding his father continued to linger much beyond the period his covetous and ungrateful heart would have assigned him, and unwilling longer to support him, took measures, under pretense of obtaining for him better medical advice than he could at home provide, to have him conveyed to the city hospital. Yet his affairs were then in a flourishing state; and everything that he possessed he owed to his unhappy parent, whose age and infirmities, whose tears and entreaties, he alike disregarded. This unnatural son could not, however, contrive to conduct the matter so secretly as to elude the observation and the reproaches of all classes of people in the city. He at first tried to impose, both upon his friends and the public, by the false representations which he set on foot; but finding these could not avail him, he resolved, in order the better to disarm the popular voice against him, to send his own children with little presents to their grandfather. On one occasion he gave to his eldest boy, about six years of age, two fine cambric shirts, desiring him, early the next morning, to take them carefully to his poor grandfather in the hospital. The little boy, with an expression of great respect and tenderness in his countenance, promised that he would do so; and on his return the next day, his father, calling him into his presence, inquired whether he had delivered them safe into the hands of his grandfather. ""I only gave him one, father,"" replied the little boy. ""What!"" exclaimed Vincenti, with an angry voice. ""Did I not tell you both were for your grandfather?"" ""Yes,"" returned the little fellow, with a steady and undaunted look, ""but I thought that I would keep one of them for you, father, against the time when I shall have to send you, I hope, to the hospital. "" ""How!"" exclaimed Vincenti, ""would you ever have the cruelty to send me there, my boy?"" ""Why not?"" retorted the lad; ""Let him that does evil, expect evil in return. For you know you made your own father go there, old and ailing as he is, and he never did you any harm in his life, and do you think I shall not send you, when I am able? Indeed, father, I am resolved that I will; for it is written, 'For the stranger is in my thinking exactly like my old man , and I cannot bear him any longer. '"" ""Oh, how can I bear you!"" exclaimed Vincenti, with flowing ire. ""Of course it is your father,"" replied the lad; ""but speak to me here if you know what he is going to do. "" ""Tomorrow,"" he anxiously remarked, ""that will be quite contrary to my plan. "" Leaping suddenly out of bed, he at once extinguished his candle, locked the door, and ran to fetch the key out of the hole.

But she prevailed at length, and the bells so coveted were removed from the tower and dispatched on horseback on their way to Durham under the care of some monks. They journeyed till they reached the River Font, which, owing to a quantity of rain having fallen, was much swelled. However, they prepared to ford it; but when the horses reached the middle of the stream the bells by some means fell, or, according to the popular belief, were removed from the backs of the horses by miraculous interposition, and sank to the bottom. Owing either to the dangerous state of the stream or from the bells being unwilling to be removed, the exertions of the monks to recover them proved unavailing; so they returned to Brinkburn and reported the disaster. But the Brinkburn prior, determined not to be baffled, sent forthwith a messenger to Durham to request the presence of his brother prior, and both ecclesiasties then proceeded with a full attendance to liberate the imprisoned bells; and lo! the superior abilities of high church functionaries over humble monks was manifest to everyone; for they had no sooner ridden into the stream than the bells were lifted with ease; and, being conveyed to Durham, were lodged there in safety.

Like the Grimms, he molded authentic folklore material into a simple, but literate style, a style that has endured for more than a century. Unlike the Grimms (and unlike virtually every other nineteenth-century folklorist) Afanasyev did not shy away from patently offensive material and language. His published stories are innocent enough, but he also kept manuscript collections of obscene stories. These were smuggled out of Russia and first published (in Russian, under the title Russian Secret Tales ) in Switzerland in 1872. Anticlerical, scatological, erotic, and often crude, these tales, reflect a vulgar side of everyday life in the nineteenth century that many would rather not think about.

Which of course did not last long, for one day he was fetching water to a boiling pot, when a man stepped up to him and said, ""What are you doing there, sir?"" ""Oh, my good neighbor has got the pot all on fire. "" ""What!"" said the storyteller, ""do you think I would allow my person to be used as a fuel for such a chimney?"" ""Well, now think about it. If I were you, I should not attempt to trap every last piece of game that walks down to the river. You would be as bold with the pigeons and much less likely to gain as much money as you might if you gave them no opportunity for gain. "" These words only made the storyteller more angry. ""Oh, you impudence!"" he said, ""before you boast of such foolishness, tell me how you are going to get my child off the bank?"" ""Oh, sir,"" answered the father, ""as you can see, the child is hanging over the bank by a piece. "" And straightway the storyteller turned to the other man and said, ""If I were you, I would not attempt to trap every last animal that comes to the river; you would be as wild and as popular as they are today. "" These words only made the man more angry. ""Fetch a boat,"" said he to the storyteller. ""And if I were you, I would not attempt to play the part of guardian or hunter, and would not be regarded as such, but as one of the common people, capable of being led away in order to be used as fuel.

She came, and looked in, and saw that the man was right behind the bankAll the time counting with his little finger, pretending to be busy. At last she overtook him, and having counted to two, threw the little finger aside,Whereupon the man cried out, ""That's two for you. "" ""You are quite right,"" said the woman to him, ""and we were hoping for more. "" But she had no sooner spoken these words than the boat began to rise; and immediately lost sight of him, and came to the point where they ran up against each other. And though the speed of the current was such that he quite escaped being seen, the crew of the vessel thought it best to wind the oarsmen's hair into a cap, and bathed him with a shower of rainwater. This done, they took him back to their ship, and placed him, as before, in a corner behind the door. While they were bathing he thought over and over again of the fox who had advised him, and said to himself, ""If I could only make my wife shower her hair into a cap, and bathe her with a shower, she would become as beautiful as the Da Vinci of the Turks.

The minister, a widower when he married Marion Halcro, was deeply attached to his young wife, and bitter was his anguish when, a few months after the marriage, she was cut off by a short illness. Mr. Erskine resolved that her trinkets and jewellery should be buried with her, and a valuable ring was left upon her finger. When John Carr, village carpenter, and sexton of Chirnside Parish Church, came to screw down the coffin lid, the minister, gazing on the features of his beloved wife, thought he saw the lips quiver. Every available test was vainly tried in the fond hope that life had not departed. But Carr had seen the jewellery, examined the bracelets, and had even tried whether the ring would slip off without difficulty, for he thought it a pity that such beautiful articles should be lost. To save himself subsequent labour and time, the nails were loosely screwed, and in late afternoon at the graveyard, consulting the feelings of the bereaved husband, the earth was lightly thrown in, the considerate sexton remarking that he could finish the work better in daylight. At night Carr returned to the burial ground, quickly removed the earth, and opened the coffin. The ring was first sought, but it refused to leave its place. Taking his knife, the operator placed the finger on the edge of the coffin and proceeded to amputation. With the opening of a vein vitality was restored, and Mrs. Erskine uttered a piercing shriek. Carr yelled and fled, leaving the lady to get out of the grave as best she might. Weak and cold as a corpse, she found her way home, but even at the manse her troubles were not over. The door was locked, though the inmates had not retired. The minister was strangely affected by the knock, which was exactly that of his late wife, and the old servant who opened the door fainted on seeing the apparition. But Margaret Halcro, even in such an emergency, was practical. The terrified husband could not believe the voice which declared that this was no ghost, but his own living and loving wife. While he stood helpless, Mrs. Erskine, shivering in her grave clothes, slipped past and hurried to the study, where there was a fire. Stimulants were administered, and the bed, warmed with hot bricks, soon restored her to comfort, and she was able to relate in detail her terrible experiences, through all of which she had been perfectly conscious. She told of her great effort to speak when her husband was looking at her in her coffin; of Carr's examination of the jewellery; and of her calculating on the sexton's return to the grave.

For as they neither ate nor drank enough to fuel their bodies, they were soon cut to the heart by the cares of everyday life. Therefore, whilst they were yet the strongest, they laid down their rifles and blankets, which at that time were neither fire-breathed nor bedevilled with evil spirits. Whilst they were stiffly sitting there, an ever-lasting light shone in the air, and flamed up into a million lights of various shades. Impelled by curiosity, Hugh approached the light, and looking at it, saw a host of ghosts -- spirits of the lowest orders, malformed and hideous, but also skilled in the arts of ghostly illusion. Far and wide across the wide ocean, from the northern shores to the southern towns, a homeless population wended their way, hungry and cold, to seek shelter in the deserted places.

Raising his hunting horn, he blew in the smoke, and following the intimation, flew to the spot to enjoy the fresh air before sunrise. He had scarcely arrived when he heard a stifled groaning sound in the air, and saw a staghead pop out of the ground. Tired as he was, he laid down in his place and took the coverings from his head. Soon afterwards the groaning sound was heard again, but this time it was in chorus with the voices of hundred spirits. The chief of them all then arose and proceeded to punish the perpetrators of the breach of faith. This was Hugh de Beer, who was sentenced to be hung as soon as the latter part of the sentence was accomplished. --Grose's Magia, p. 215.",0.7965019258069176,0.7965019258069176,0.0,0.0

The knight, perceiving that he had manifestly shown his inability to win a battle against these invisible enemies, withdrew his army from the field of battle, and returned to his city. Here he discovered the snake Sæmund the Wise, who influenced him to abandon the expedition, and to decline taking part in the war. The king ordered his sons to be called, and said to the knight, ""Your fault is your own. Do you not know that these enemies are only shadows of their former selves. Their strength is only a by-product of their evil nature. "" The king then placed a hundred knights in a high tower near the river, where they were to watch the movements of the demons. Odin stood by as a spirit guide. The king allowed him to carry a fire-arrow with him, and to place it in the hoof of his horse. When the spirits appeared to attack the horses, he laid the fire-arrow on the pile, where it was to remain until the next time he brought it. When the king's army returned from the field, they found the horses alive and well, but the demons had disappeared. The only mark left was a large cavern where the elephant Teupitz had entered. A large bell was then placed in the elephant's hoof. A slave was given the task of ringing the bell.

"" This stream of words gushed forth, not ceasing until the husband stopped her mouth with his fist. One evening the couple were again quarrelling in their hut when a stately woman dressed in clothes of German cut stepped inside. Her appearance brought the wife's tongue to a standstill, and caused the husband to lower his raised arm. After a friendly greeting, the strange woman said, ""You are poor wretches and until now have suffered much. However, three days from now your misery will suddenly end. Therefore keep peace in your house, and decide what destiny you would best choose for yourselves. I am not a human, as I appear to you, but rather a higher being who, through God's power, can cause wishes to be fulfilled. You have three days' time for consideration, and then you may state three wishes that you desire. Say your wishes aloud, and in the same instant they will come true through magic power. But be careful not to wish for unnecessary things. "" Following these words, the stately woman greeting them once again, then disappeared out the door in a flash. Loppi and Lappi, who had now forgotten their quarrel, stared speechlessly out the door through which the miraculous vision had entered and disappeared. Finally the husband said, ""Let's go to bed now. We have three days to think about this. We want to use these wishes wisely, so we can get the best luck for ourselves. "" Although they had three days for consideration, they spent more than half the night burdened with thoughts of which wish would be the very very best. Oh, what precious freedom ruled in the hut without interruption for the next three days! Loppi and Lappi had become different people. They spoke together friendlily, and looked after one another's needs. They spent the greatest part of each day sitting quietly in the corner thinking about what they should wish for. On the third day Loppi went into the village, where that morning a swine had been slaughtered, and the sausage kettle must just now be standing on the fire. He took with him the butter pot, with its lid, wanting to ask his neighbor's wife for sausage water to cook his cabbage in that evening. Loppi felt that they would be able to think better if their stomachs were filled with good food. Arriving home he put the cabbage on the fire so their meal would be ready at the right time. Evening arrived, and with it the time when they could make their wishes. The pot of cabbage soup was steaming on the table, and husband and wife sat down to eat. Now they could have their wishes fulfilled. They had already eaten several spoonfuls of the tasty soup when Lappi said, contentedly, ""Thanks be to God for this good soup. It will fill us up nicely, but it would taste even better if we only had a sausage to go with it!"" Bang! A small sausage fell from above onto the middle of the table. For a while husband and wife were so startled that it did not occur to them to eat the sausage. Loppi remarked that with the sausage their first wish had been fulfilled, and that so angered him that he shouted, ""May the Evil One grab you and stick this sausage onto your nose! If. "" But the poor man was too frightened to continue speaking, for the sausage was already hanging from Lappi's nose, not like a normal sausage, but like a piece of flesh growing out of the nose. What could they do now? Two wishes had already been wasted, and the second one had so misshapen the woman that she would not dare to be seen by other people. They still had one wish that had not been stated, and with this one they could set everything right. At this moment poor Lappi had no other desire than to free herself from the long sausage, so she said this wish aloud, and the sausage disappeared. Now all three wishes were gone, and Loppi and Lappi had to continue living poorly in their hut. For some time afterward they expected the beautiful woman to return, but the stranger never appeared again.

He was nervously afraid to start the horses, and yet was so delighted with the way his mind and body answered the call, that he took no notice of the wound he had received of it.

In the meanwhile, the tortoise came jogging on, with a slow but continued motion; and the hare, out of a too great security and confidence of victory, oversleeping herself, the tortoise arrived at the end of the race first. THE APPLICATION Industry and application to business makes amends for the want of a quick and ready wit. Hence it is, that the victory is not always to the strong, nor the race to the swift. Men of fine parts are apt to despise the drudgery of business; but by affecting to show the superiority of their genius, upon many occasions, they run into too great an extreme the other way; and the administration of their affairs is ruined through idleness and neglect. What advantage has a man from the fertility of his invention, and the vivacity of his imagination, unless his resolutions are executed with a suitable and uninterrupted rapidity? In short, your men of wit and fire, as they are called, are often times sots, slovens, and lazy fellows; they are generally proud and conceited to the last degree; and in the main, not the fittest persons for either conversation or business. -- Such is their vanity, they think the sprightliness of their humor inconsistent with a plain sober way of thinking and speaking, and able to atone for all the little neglects of their business and person. But the world will not be thus imposed upon: the man who would gain the esteem of others, and make his own fortune, must be one that carries his point effectually, and finishes his course without swerving and loitering. Men of dull parts, and slow apprehension, assisted by a continued diligence, are more likely to attain this, than your brisk retailers of wit, with their affected spleen and indolence.

The man asked him how he had disposed of his time in summer, that he had not taken pains and laid in a stock, as they had done. ""My son,"" says he, ""I passed away the time merrily and pleasantly, in drinking, singing, and dancing, and never once thought of winter. ""If that be the case,"" replied the ant, ""all I have to say is this: that they who drink, sing, and dance in the summer, must starve in the winter. "" The Application: As summer is the season in which the industrious laborious husbandman lays up his supplies for the winter, so youth and manhood are the times of life which we should employ in laying in such a stock as may suffice for helpless old age; yet there are many whom we call rational creatures, who squander away in a profuse prodigality, whatever they get in their younger days, as if the infirmity of age would require no supplies to support it, or at least would find them administered to it in some miraculous way. From this fable we learn this admirable lesson, never to lose the present opportunity of fairly and honestly providing against the future evils and accidents of life; and while health and the vigour of our faculties remain firm and entire, to lay them out to the best advantage; so that when age and infirmities despoil us of our strength and abilities, we may not have to bewail that we have neglected to provide for the wants of our latter days: for it should always be remembered, that ""a youth of revels breeds an age of care,"" and that temperance in youth lays the foundation of health and comfort for old age.",0.5678049647489021,0.5678049647489021,0.0,0.0

IV How he met with an old Hermit, who for a Bottle of nappy Ale, gave him an invincible Coat and a Pair of inchanted Pipes, with which he shewed many merry Tricks. Upon a pleasant holyday. Jack going to a fair, And as he passed along the way, He saw a wonder there. An aged man sat in a Cave, Who could not stand nor go, His head bore blossoms of the grave, And locks as white as snow, Strange hollow eyes and wrinkled brow His nose and chin did meet, To him Jack Homer made a bow, With words both soft and sweet. He call'd to John and thus did say, Come hither lad to me, And if thou dost my will obey, Thou shalt rewarded be: Bring me a fairing from the town, At thy own proper cost, A jug of nappy liquor brown, Thy labour shan't be lost. Jack made the Hermit this reply, Who then sat in his cell, What's your request I'll not deny, And so old dad farewel. At night he being stout and strong, This Hermit he'd not fail, But at his back he lug'd along, A lusty jug of ale: Which when the Hermit he beheld, It pleas'd him to the heart; Out of the same cup he fill'd, And said, Before we part, I have a pipe which I'll bestow Upon you never doubt, Whoever hears you when you blow, Shall dance and trump about: They shan't be able to stand still While you the Music play, But after you o'er dale and hill, They all shall dance the hay. I have thee a coat likewise, Invincible I mean, The which shall so bedim their eyes, That thou shalt not be seen: If you with a hundred meet, When thus you pass along, Though in the very open street, Not one of all the throng, Shall ever see you in the least, Yet hear the music sound, And wonder that both man and beast, Are forced to dance around. Jack took the Coat and Bagpipes too, And thankfully did say, Old Father I will call on you Whene'er I come this way. CHAP. V How he serv'd six Fidlers, and as many Pedlers, whom he caused to dance thro' Hedge and Ditch after his Pipes, till they broke all their Glasses and Crowds. This Pipe and coat he having got, He homeward trudg'd with speed, At length it was his happy Lot to cross a pleasant Mead: Where he six Fidlers soon espy'd a coming from a Fair, Under their Coats, crowds by their sides, and many others there: Amongst the rest six jolly blades, after those crowders came, Who on their shoulders carried Crades with Glasses in the same. Jack presently his Coat put on, Which screen'd him from their sight, And said I'll do the best I can To plague them all this night. For Crowders they are Rogues I know And Crades-men they are worse, They cousin all where'er they go, And pick each Lass's purse. His pipe he then began to play, The Crowders they did dance, The Crades-men too as fast as they Did caper, skip, and prance. Still Jack play'd up a merry strain, Both pleasant, loud, and shrill, So that they danc'd and jump'd amain Tho' much against their Will: They cried, this is enchanted Ground, For why no soul we see, And yet a pleasant Music sound, Makes, us dance vehemently. Jack Homer laugh'd, and piping went Strait down into a hollow, These hair brain'd Dancers, by consent Did after him soon follow, He led them through Bogs and Sloughs Nay, likewise Ponds and Ditches, And in the thorny briar boughs Poor rogues they tore their Breeches, Each Fidler lost, or tore his Cloak, But yet they followed after, Their crow'ds were, crack'd their glasses broke, This was a woeful slaughter. At length it being something late, Jack did his piping leave, They ceased and saw their wretched state, Which made them sigh and grieve. This is, said some, Old Nick I know The author of this evil, The others cry'd out, if it be so, He is a merry Devil. Jack Horner laugh'd and went his Way And left them in despair, So that e'er since that very day, The Fidlers came not there.",0.42722523788373423,0.42722523788373423,0.0,0.0

There the pupils learned witchcraft and all sorts of ancient arts. Wherever this school was, it was somewhere below ground, and was held in a strong room which, as it had no window, was eternally dark and changeless. There was no teacher either, but everything was learnt from books with fiery letters, which could be read quite easily in the dark. Never were the pupils allowed to go out into the open air or see the daylight during the whole time they stayed there, which was from five to seven years. By then they had gained a thorough and perfect knowledge of the sciences to be learnt at that school. A shaggy gray hand came through the wall every day with the pupils' meals, and when they had finished eating and drinking took back the horns and platters. But one of the rules of the school was, that the owner should keep for himself that one of the students who should leave the school the last every year. And, considering that it was pretty well known among the pupils that the devil himself was the master, you may fancy what a scramble there was at each year's end, everybody doing his best to avoid being last to leave the school. It happened once that three Icelanders went to this school, by the name of Sæmundur the Learned, Kálfur Arnason, and Hálfdán Eldjárnsson; and as they all arrived at the same time, they were all supposed to leave at the same time. Sæmundur declared himself willing to be the last of them, at which the others were much lightened in mind. So he threw over himself a large mantle, leaving the sleeves loose and the fastenings free. A staircase led from the school to the upper world, and when Sæmundur was about to mount this the devil grasped at him and said, ""You are mine!"" But Sæmundur slipped out of this mantle and made off with all speed, leaving the devil the empty cloak. However, just as he left the school the heavy iron door was slammed suddenly to, and wounded Sæmundur on the heels. Then he said, ""That was pretty close upon my heels,"" which words have since passed into a proverb. The Sæmundur contrived to escape from the Black School, with his companions, scot-free. Some people relate, that, when Sæmundur came into the doorway, the sun shone upon him and threw his shadow onto the opposite wall. And as the devil stretched out his hand to grapple with him, Sæmundur said, ""I am not the last. Do you not see who follows me?"" So the devil seized the shadow, mistaking it for a man, and Sæmundur escaped with a blow on his heels from the iron door.

At last, hearing of the wisdom of King Solomon, he came to him and laid his case before him.

King Solomon answered, ""I have always been of one that loved the former more than the latter, and so long as I remain so I shall remain, but I hope that you, as king, will raise me up.

She forgot to take off the strap, and therefore the curse fell upon her shoulders, and thus upon their own heads. They still looked up at the castle, and the wolf's heart laughed within her.

The king wanted to know when she was coming to visit him, but she had to tell him that she could not go with him for some years. The dragon's reply was, ""I cannot accompany you.

She had five children with him, but instead of becoming rich through her husband's work, she became a poor woman. After giving birth to the last child, she found the child dead on the grass bank, and thereon grew up the story of the woman who became a werewolf in an act of revenge. Now it frequently happened that women lost their children under the presumption that their husbands had been unfaithful to them, and thus they became full werewolves during the time that the child lived. However, even then they could change back into their human forms. Thus, a woman lost her first child at the very end of her marriage, and thus did not become rich through her husband's work, but became a poor woman. She could change into wolf-woman as well as into human woman by licking the blood from her new childbirth. Therefore it happened that werewolves also often looked after the needs of women who became poor through no fault of their own. Thus in Lasswitz every week numerous women came to see a woman who had just given birth who had not had food or drink for several days, and who did not understand how they could get enough to eat.

About the origin of these stones it is related that at this place several hundred years ago a number of people gathered on Holy Whitsunday to carry out a naked dance. As special punishment for their wicked behavior they were turned into stones. Thus the stones are called ""the Adam's Dance,"" or ""the Stone Dance.

After the Greifswald stonemasons had cut up the large stones they became curious about what might be buried in the earth beneath them. They therefore began to dig into one of the graves, where they found many human corpses. They were completely preserved and enormously large. They measured between eleven and sixteen feet in length, and they all lay in a row. Between each one there was a jar filled with earth. When they began digging into the second grave they heard a great commotion beneath the earth, as though people were dancing and rattling bunches of keys.

The male sang longer than the female, and when the female began to climb upward he jumped up and caught hold of her and drew her up. Then he threw her into the water. The other swans flew up and locked her in. The jackdaw stayed behind and sang, until she returned with her young. She locked him in as well, but he escaped. He ran away inside singing another tune, and soon came back outside singing another.

They came to a lonely place, where Jesus made three heaps of earth, and by his word turned them into three blocks of massive gold. The Jew then endeavored to take away the blocks of gold, but found them too heavy to be moved. When he was thus wasting his strength in trying to move them, Jesus returned to the spot, and said to the Jew, ""Have nothing to do with these heaps of gold. They will cause the death of three men. Leave them and follow me. "" The man obeyed, and leaving the gold where it lay, went away with Jesus. Three travelers then happened to pass that way, and were delighted to find the gold. They agreed that each should take one. Finding it, however, a matter of impossibility to remove them, they resolved that one of them should go to the city for carts and food for them to eat, whilst the other two should watch the treasure. So one of the travelers set out for the city, leaving the other two to guard the gold. During his absence the thoughts of the two travelers were engrossed in projecting some means whereby they could become the sole sharers of the gold to the exclusion of the one who had gone to the city. They finally came to the diabolical resolution to kill their companion on his return. The same murderous design had entered the mind of the latter in reference to his two companions. He bought food and mixed poison with it; and then returned to the spot to offer it to them. No sooner had he arrived there, than without a word of warning his companions fell upon him, and belabored him to death. They then began to eat the food which was in its turn to destroy them; and so as they were partaking of this poisoned repast, they fell down, and expired in the struggles of death. A little while after, Jesus and the Jew were returning from their journey along that road, and seeing the three men lying dead amidst the gold, Jesus exclaimed, ""This will be the end of the covetous, who love gold. "" He then raised the three men to life, and elicited from them a confession of their guilt. They repented of their sin, and thence forward became disciples of Jesus. Nothing, however, could make the Jew overcome his avarice.

No sooner had the count spoken the word than the Osenberg opened, and out of the cleft there came a beautiful maiden, fairly adorned and handsomely dressed, and with her beautiful hair divided on her shoulders, and a garland on her head. And she had a rich silver vessel, that was gilded and shaped like a hunter's horn, well and ingeniously made, granulated, and fairly ornamented.

When the count had received and taken this gilded silver horn from the maiden, and had opened it and looked into it, the drink, or whatever it was that was in it, when he shook it, did not please him, and he therefore refused to drink for the maiden. Whereupon the maiden said, ""My dear lord, drink of it upon my faith, for it will do you no harm, but will be of advantage;"" adding farther, that if the count would drink out of it, it would go well with him, count Otto, and his, and also with the whole house of Oldenburg after him, and that the whole country would improve and flourish. But if the count would place no faith in her, and would not drink of it, then for the future, in the succeeding family of Oldenburg, there would remain no unity.

Now Richard had a habit, while he was a boy, of always walking back and forth over the river to the spot where the children were drowned.

Previously they vied with one another in trying to please their father, hoping thus to receive more money, but now they had received their patrimony, they cared not how soon he left them -- nay, the sooner the better, because he was only a needless trouble and expense. This, as we may suppose, was a great grief to the old man. One day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles. The friend sympathized very much with him, and promised to think over the matter, and call in a little while and tell him what to do. He did so; in a few days he visited the old man and put down four bags full of stones and gravel before him. ""Look here, friend,"" said he.

In the night the devil came to her in the form of her beloved, and he called upon her to pledge her soul to him. In return he would accompany her, in this form, as long as she lived. Further, he would give her great magic power. She agreed to this, and the devil remained with her. He was not exactly invisible, but still secret, and no one knew about him. After a while he advised her to enter a convent, which she did. She would now lock herself in her cell with her beloved, while her phantom form was praying in the church. She gained the reputation of great piety, and soon afterward became the abbess. From this time forward miraculous events began to occur in the convent. Most prominently, from time to time several nuns were attacked with long-lasting and unknown ailments, which she was able to cure through her apparent intercession. Thus her holy reputation grew ever greater. The first suspicion came from several children who often visited the convent. The abbess, who loved children, would show them magic tricks whenever she was alone with them. She told others about this, although she had strictly forbidden them to do so. Above all, the abbess would ask the children if they would like her to make some little mice for them, whereupon the table would immediately be crawling with small, tame mice. The children were too young for one to give much credibility to their talk, but once a young nun, on her way to church, passed by the abbess's cell and heard the abbess whispering lightly with a man's voice. Curious, she looked through the keyhole and saw the abbess and an officer. But when she entered the church she saw the abbess's form praying there before the altar, and she feinted with fright.

The rumors apparently took their rise in the fact that one Muhammadan and three Hindu children have been missing in Madras and have not yet been traced, though the circumstances attending their disappearance did not suggest foul play. But once rumor had got about, false alarms began to be raised whenever a child slipped out of sight for a few minutes. Thus people's minds became excited and they fell into a panic. As a result, in the last two days several innocent people have been savagely assulted by excited crowds in different parts of the town, having come under suspicion for perfectly innocent actions. Thus, one man seen carrying his own child on a motorcycle was stopped and assulted. A person appears to have been beaten to death. The Commissioner of Police has taken all possible steps to restore confidence, and the Coproration has been invited to assist. It is hoped that all members of the public will help in allaying this foolish panic which has already had such tragic consequences.

At that time no people lived here yet, and the dwarfs liked that, for they could carry on as they wished either above or below ground, and not be disturbed. They had a good life. For them every day was Sunday, with a holiday in the middle of each week. They ate and drank, played and danced, and at times did metalsmithing as well. Even today people often find the slag from the hard coal that they used in their work. When the first herder came to this region he found nothing but fields of peas surrounding the mountain, and the most beautiful music sounded from within the mountain without interruption. However, when his sheep approached the pea fields, they jumped about as though someone were secretly pinching them. Moreover, his dog would often begin to yelp, and refused to approach the place again. However, more and more people came here, establishing villages and conducting business. They often came into contact with the dwarfs, who were sometimes friendly and sometimes hostile, just as it happened. The underground people complained most of all about the humans' noisy activities, and, on the other hand, the humans complained about the thefts commtted by the underground people. But still, they often lent one another a helping hand, and whenever the humans did something for the dwarfs, they were rewarded with red gold. Thus there was once a poor but pious servant girl who was busy cleaning out the house. Just as she about to carry the sweepings outside, she discovered a letter lying in her dustpan. It was addressed to her. Standing her broom against the wall, she read it. In the letter she was summoned to stand in as a godparent for a dwarf child the next day, and was promised that no harm would come to her. She did not want to do this, but her employers told her that she must not decline, for if she did so, it would not go well for her. Thus she went forth that night, for that was when she was told to come. At twelve o'clock the mountain opened, and now she was just as pleased as she earlier had been afraid, for down there it was immense and magnificent. Everything was made of pure gold, and everyone was friendly and well disposed toward her. After giving the child a name, they laid it into a golden cradle, and the musicians played until it fell asleep again. Then they had the best things to eat and drink, after which they danced and sang until morning on a large meadow. After they were tired, the girl said that she wanted to return home, but the dwarfs begged and begged until she finally agreed to stay three more days, and all three days were filled with pleasure and joy. When she finally started out for home, the dwarfs rewarded her most generously and bestially. They divided her goods equally among all three days, then locked her and her little arm behind the gate. She returned home with her arm in condition (karma) and her purse in (saivas), and immediately her employers returned. They looked in to see if there was any damage.

They might take whatever sort of vessel they liked, to milk her into, so long as it was only one apiece, she would always fill it. Well, and at last there came an old witch, Mitchell her name was.

He now began to speak indecently to them, and showed, in every way that they knew, how greatly he regretted what he had done. After hearing all of this, the chief of the forest begged the chief of the village to have the lion turned back, as he thought that turning back the lion would be a easy matter, as he had turned down three other men instead of one. The latter told him that it would not be so easy, for the way was blocked by a fat old tiger with a flying squirrel sitting astride its muzzle. The old tiger did not want to give up the bugbear, and tried to make a little detour around the blockage, but he was wrong. The huge beast seized the branch in his hand and rammed it down on the turtle's plate. The dwarf sprang up screaming loudly, and the tiger began to laugh uproariously. As soon as he heard the other two talking, he rushed up to them and said, ""Why do you sob and cry? Is your grandmother not dead?"" ""Yes, she is indeed,"" answered the turtle, ""and she has brought such grief to us that we are unable to consider you as a friend.

And when the prince found himself in bed all worn out and useless, the lion arose and found there a beautiful female tiger with a large coal on its muzzle, and a sleeping bugbear beneath. The dwarf unhesitatingly tied the sleeping bugbear to the lion's tail, and the lion, driven by lust, broke the tail off, and the tiger woke up and found there a beautiful female mouse with a big cat's paw. The dwarf unhesitatingly carried the mouse away and carried the cat away with him. The river ran salty, and the two fish died, but the mouse went on swimming, and she returned home to her parents uninjured.

He asked the cause, and learned that the landlord, who had been too fond of his money, had sold the place to the most extraordinary price. The prince had to accept the offer, and he decided to look around for another place to settle down in. Suddenly he fell into a deep hole which the earth was moving under. He escaped from the hole with his booty, and he came to another place where the people seemed to be even more sad than the first. He much more properly inquired into the matter, and he found that the prince had been lord of this most beautiful castle for many years, and had even had his own daughter married there. How could he have left her there? How had he failed to secure a bridegroom? He grew more and more troubled, and he entreated his minister for help. The minister told him that it was impossible to revoke the prince's oath, but that he could give him one year's time to decide whether he would like to take the princess or not. The year's time had come. The prince had his army prepare for battle. He then returned to the palace to inquire if the marriage was indeed to take place.

This grieved him in his latter years, his heart being good and pious; so to make the evil good again, he wrote a book, wherein he first shows how evil is to be done, and then how it may be remedied. The book begins by explaining what sorcery is, and with a warning against it. It is divided into three heads, viz. Cyprianus, Dr. Faustus, and Jacob Ramel. The last two parts are written in characters which are said to be Persian or Arabic, and also in ordinary characters. In this book are taught exorcising, laying and raising of spirits, and all that of which mention is made in the 5th book of Moses (XVIII: 10-12). Whether this book has been printed is uncertain, but manuscript copies of it are concealed here and there among the common people, who regard it as something sacred. Those who possess the book of Cyprianus need never want money; they can read the devil to them and from them, and no one can harm them, not even the devil himself. But whoever possesses the book cannot get rid of it; for whether he sells, burns or buries it, it will come back; and if a person cannot dispose of it before his death, it will go badly with him. The only method is, to write his name in it in his own blood, and lay it in a secret place in the church, together with four shillings clerk's fee. The following is the German tradition of Cyprianus: In ancient times there lived in one of the Danish isles a man named Cyprianus, who was worse than the devil; consequently, after he was dead and gone to hell, he was again cast forth by the devil and replaced on his isle. There he wrote nine books, in the old Danish tongue, on witchcraft and magical spells. Whosoever has read all these nine books through becomes the property of the devil. From the original work three (or nine) copies are said to have been made by a monk, and mutilated copies of these to have been dispersed all over the world. A count, who resided in the castle of Plön, is said to have possessed a perfect copy, which he caused to be fastened with chains and buried under the castle; because in reading through eight books he was so troubled and terrified through fear of being arrested by the law, and obliged to appear in the castle, that he resolved on concealing it from the sight of the world. One of these books still exists in Flensburg. Some spells from the nine books are still known among aged people",0.6409931211582024,0.7409931211582024,-0.1,0.0

He was going to do it, when a lion woman came out and offered him a drink from a glistening golden bottle. Taking the bottle, he slung it over his back, and following the sound of the waves, he emerged upon the other side of the jungle and was about to leave. The hungry lion was sitting in his place, and noticed the beautiful robe. It was silk, of a kind that was not seen in any other land. He untied it and looked about to find that it was apron. He then followed his master to the well, and having found it, he was able to say nothing to him. The master was much annoyed with him for this, and told him that he must pay him well, but the lion made such a fuss and moaning that he would have melted a heart of stone, and nothing would content him but that somebody should carry him back to land and let him fetch his meat on her head, or to kill him and get it upon her head, what man could help him here? So he returned to the town and charged them for his fare, and then going to his master, he thanked him exceedingly for the food, and having said this, carried the lion back to its lair. The same lion, avarice and lust followed the lion wherever he went, until he reached the point where he was to meet a number of his friends -- whose appearance was a surprise to him, as he had never seen any mouse before, and who appeared to be much older than himself. The prince did not recognize him in his white dress, and would not let him feed with them, but stayed away from him. The fish and some of his friends approached him, but the lion was still unwilling to part with the beautiful robe, and, casting a cloak around his shoulders, carried him home. Preparations were soon made for a magnificent wedding, which took place in due form, and the young couple dwelt lovingly and contentedly together. One Thursday evening, seven years later, the hunter related to her how he had sought and won his wife. He brought forth and showed her, also, the white robe, but said that he would not wear it, and that instead of it she should put on a silk robe, which he laid across her shoulders, and then accompanied him to the door. She answered, ""Yes! I can do that!"" and she put the robe on his back, and they drove home together.

One day, at the chase, he went to a fountain to quench his thirst. As he approached it he heard the voice of a woman singing, and on coming to it he found there the beautiful fay Pressina. After some time the fay bestowed her hand upon him, on the condition that he should never visit her at the time of her lying-in. She had three daughters at a birth: Melusina, Melior, and Palatina. Nathas, the king's son by a former wife, hastened to convey the joyful tidings to his father, who, without reflection, flew to the chamber of the queen, and entered as she was bathing her daughters. Pressina, on seeing him, cried out that he had broken his word, and she must depart. And taking up her three daughters, she disappeared. She retired to the Lost Island, so called because it was only by chance any, even those who had repeatedly visited it, could find it. Here she reared her children, taking them every morning to a high mountain, whence Albania might be seen, and telling them that but for their father's breach of promise they might have lived happily in the distant land which they beheld. When they were fifteen years of age, Melusina asked her mother particularly of what their father had been guilty. On being informed of it, she conceived the design of being revenged on him. Engaging her sisters to join in her plans, they set out for Albania. Arrived there, they took the king and all his wealth, and, by a charm, enclosed him in a high mountain, called Brandelois. On telling their mother what they had done, she, to punish them for the unnatural action, condemned Melusina to become every Saturday a serpent, from the waist downwards, till she should meet a man who would marry her under the condition of never seeing her on a Saturday, and should keep his promise. She influenced other judgements on her two sisters, less severe in proportion to their guilt. Melusina now went roaming through the world in search of the man who was to deliver her. She passed through the Black Forest, and that of Ardennes, and at last she arrived in the forest of Colombiers, in Poitou, where all the fays of the neighborhood came before her, telling her they had been waiting for her to reign in that place. Raymond having accidentally killed the count, his uncle, by the glancing aside of his boar-spear, was wandering by night in the forest of Colombiers. He arrived at a fountain that rose at the foot of a high rock. This fountain was called by the people the Fountain of Thirst, or the Fountain of the Fays, on account of the many marvelous things which had happened at it. At the time, when Raymond arrived at the fountain, three ladies were diverting themselves there by the light of the moon, the principal of which was Melusina. Her beauty and her amiable manners quickly won his love. She soothed him, concealed the deed he had done, and married him, he promising on his oath never to desire to see her on a Saturday. She assured him that a breach of his oath would forever deprive him of her whom he so much loved, and be followed by the unhappiness of both for life.

The old man had been drinking, and in that state wandered away, and was found by some peasants, who carried him to their king, Midas. Midas recognized him, and treated him hospitably, entertaining him for ten days and nights with an unceasing round of jollity. On the eleventh day he brought Silenus back, and restored him in safety to his pupil. Whereupon Bacchus offered Midas his choice of a reward, whatever he might wish. He asked that whatever he might touch should be changed into gold. Bacchus consented, though sorry that he had not made a better choice. Midas went his way, rejoicing in his new-acquired power, which he hastened to put to the test. He could scarce believe his eyes when he found a twig of an oak, which he plucked from the branch, become gold in his hand. He took up a stone; it changed to gold. He touched a sod; it did the same. He took up an apple from the tree; you would have thought he had robbed the garden of the Hesperides. His joy knew no bounds, and as soon as he got home, he ordered the servants to set a splendid repast on the table. Then he found to his dismay that whether he touched bread, it hardened in his hand; or put a morsel to his lip, it defied his teeth. He took a glass of wine, but it flowed down his throat like melted gold. In consternation at the unprecedented affliction, he strove to divest himself of his power; he hated the gift he had lately coveted. But all in vain; starvation seemed to await him. He raised his arms, all shining with gold, in prayer to Bacchus, begging to be delivered from his glittering destruction. Bacchus, merciful deity, heard and consented. ""Go,"" said he, ""to River Pactolus, trace its fountain-head, there plunge yourself and body in, and wash away your fault and its punishment. "" He did so, and scarce had he touched the waters before the gold-creating power passed into them, and the river sands became changed into gold, as they remain to this day. Thenceforth Midas, hating wealth and splendor, dwelt in the country, and became a worshipper of Pan, the god of the fields.

She promised that on three distinct occasions when he or his clan were in danger, he might wave the flag with certainty of relief. MacLeod proved false to his fairy, and married a mere commonplace human maiden, whereupon his spirit wife waxed wroth, and ordained that every woman in the clan should give birth to a dead child, and that all the cattle should have dead calves. Then a loud and bitter wail rang through the green valleys, and along the shores, and MacLeod, in sore tribulation, bethought him of the flag. The fairy proved more true to her words than her lover had been to his, so she withdrew her spell, and the clan once more flourished. Then came a terrible battle, when MacLeod and his men were well-nigh routed, and again, though he must have been sorely ashamed of himself, he waved the flag, and the victory was his. Why the flag was not waved for the third time, when the isles were ruined by the failure of the kelp trade, or during the potato famine, MacLeod best knows.

samples-30300,"A Family Tradition Once upon a time, way back in the middle ages, the clan MacLeod was a very strong clan in Scotland, and the fairies or ""little people"" favored it much. So the queen of the fairies gave to the chief a wonderful flag which possessed the quality of granting them three wishes, but only in time of great need. The flag was carefully laid away and not brought out for a long while. At last there was great woe at Dunvegan, the castle of the MacLeods, for the heir was lost. Then someone thought of the flag and it was used, and soon after the boy was found. A second time it was used to save the chief from death, and carefully laid away again, but, alas, so carefully that it could not be found till, in 1799, an iron chest that seemed keyless was broken open and found to contain an inner case in which was a scented casket, in that the fairy flag. Now, before the finding of the flag a seer had predicted that when the third Norman son of an English lady should perish accidentally, the ""Maidens"" (three large rocks in the ocean belonging to MacLeod) should be sold to the Campbells; a fox should litter in the castle; and the fairy flag be found. The glory of the MacLeods would then depart, but to be more than recovered in the future when another chief called Ian Breac should arise. In 1799 all these things happened, but at the present time the heir presumptive is called Ian Breac, so it is to be hoped that the glory of the MacLeod's will return. The fairy flag is still shown at Dunvegan Castle, on the Isle of Skye. It is of fine yellow silk and has many so called ""elf marks"" on it in red silk thread.

The king had a gallant son named Ucay, who fell in love with a beautiful young witch, the daughter of the most bitter enemy of his father. When Ucay became old enough to marry, his father requested him to select the most beautiful lady in the city for his wife; but the prince would neither select one, nor would he tell his father about his love for the witch. So the rich king ordered his soldiers to bring to the palace all the beautiful women that could be found in the kingdom. His order was soon obeyed, but none of the girls suited the prince. So the king took the matter of selection into his own hands; and, after choosing a very handsome girl, he forced his son to marry her. Out of fear, Ucay consented to do as his father bade him. But the beautiful young witch to whom he had already pledged his love became angry with him for his timidity, and so she resolved to change the city into a forest of beautiful trees. Her fickle lover she transformed into a monkey, who should live in the tallest tree, and who should not be able to recover his human shape till five centuries had past, when a charming girl would live with him and love him more than anything else. Moreover, she changed the king's subjects into other animals as she pleased. No sooner had the marriage of the prince been proclaimed, then, than the desire of the witch was accomplished, to the great surprise of the neighboring cities. Four centuries had already passed. The wonderful disappearance of the city was already forgotten, and people from other places began to build houses in the enchanted city. The monkey-prince was always watching for an opportunity to catch a beautiful girl who should break the spell that kept him in his miserable condition. Soon a church was built near the foot of the tree in which he lived. He had already succeeded in capturing two ladies, but they had died of fear.

But one day his wife had to go to the lambskin to fetch some meat, and she took the ox with her and drove her to the field with the plow. And when she brought the meat back she and her children insisted that it was not finished, and she toiled and revived the dog, but he was sadly laid up, and his breath was not his usual swift and palfrey, and his eyes were sad and haunted. But the woman insisted that he should have his meat, and that he should eat all he could get, for his hunger was great, and if he waited long enough his fill would be at last. And while she was speaking these words she noticed that her dog crept quietly to the floor and drew himself a big quiver of arrows, and these she gave to him, and told him to bring them when he came back. But the moment his wife left him, the dog drew his quiver to its utmost and drew his last arrow, and he shot it as he stood there before her. Now her son came rushing in and saw the murder, and cried out, ""Mother, tell me what happened to my father. "" ""Well, my son,"" said her, ""he said if he came back he would find you hanging yourself in the woods, with all your children too. "" ""Well,"" I want to know,"" said the son, ""if your mother came back here she must have known some day what she was bidding me do; and accordingly she must have sent me here to inquire if I could trust myself with her children. "" ""Oh, indeed,"" returned his mother, ""do you think me so silly that I would let my own children get into a danger like that? Not with a kiss would I consent, for then I should be deemed a fool, but with the arrow I would shoot at my own head instead of my beard. You see how foolish I seem to you, and yet you are the ones that must obey my wishes. "" The son heard all this with pleasure, for he saw that the foolish woman was right frightened her son, and made him leave immediately. And as he went to stay one night in her house, he thought that she would be wicked if she took any food except for her child. So he said to himself, ""Now and then she does things that are evil, but she knows nothing about right and wrong. At this moment she is tempting me with food, but I know that she has caught me sneakingily with my wife. When I have caught her, she will be sorely punished, as she will be in this place, where there are many sorcerers.

When they were old enough, the boy and the girl went far away across the waters seeking a good place to live in. Nothing more was heard of them until their children, the Spaniards and Americans, came back. After the first boy and girl left, other children were born to the couple; but they all remained at Cibolan on Mount Apo with their parents, until Toglai and Toglibon died and became spirits. Soon after that there came a great drought which lasted for three years. All the waters dried up, so that there were no rivers, and no plants could live. ""Surely,"" said the people, ""Manama is punishing us, and we must go elsewhere to find food and a place to dwell in. "" So they started out. Two went in the direction of the sunset, carrying with them stones from Cibolan River. After a long journey they reached a place where were broad fields of cogon grass and an abundance of water, and there they made their home. Their children still live in that place and are called Magindanau, because of the stones which the couple carried when they left Cibolan. Two children of Toglai and Toglibon went to the south, seeking a home, and they carried with them women's baskets (baraan). When they found a good spot, they settled down. Their descendants, still dwelling at that place, are called Baraan or Bilaan, because of the women's baskets. So two by two the children of the first couple left the land of their birth. In the place where each settled a new people developed, and thus it came about that all the tribes in the world received their names from things that the people carried out of Cibolan, or from the places where they settled. All the children left Mount Apo save two (a boy and a girl), whom hunger and thirst had made too weak to travel. One day when they were about to die the boy crawled out to the field to see if there was one living thing, and to his surprise he found a stalk of sugarcane growing lustily. He eagerly cut it, and enough water came out to refresh him and his sister until the rains came. Because of this, their children are called Bagobo.",0.8120418075668702,0.8120418075668702,0.0,0.0

On awakening he saw a little man two feet high standing by him, and on the point of pouring a yellow liquid into, his mouth from a bottle. The hunchback looked about him, and saw to his surprise that he was in a cavern, lighted by a faint light. The dwarf spoke to him, and asked whether he was hungry. ""O yes,"" he said, and the dwarf led him into another room, where stood a covered table.

The glittering gold attracted him, and he bethought him how he could get hold of it. His pipe occurred to him. Quickly he took it in his hand, and blew hard into it. Instantly the robbers got up and danced until they fell down. Then the hunchback came out, took the money and ran away.

Go to the others; they received just as much from you as I did. "" The good father could now see very well that he was no longer wanted, and asked a neighbor for advice.

The father had the chest carried to where he was staying, then asked his daughter to lend him a scoop and three candles, for he had something that he wanted to measure. He sat up half the night making a clinging sound as if it were gold coins. The next morning he gave the scoop back to the daughter, leaving one old Bohemian coin in it. She said, ""Father, you were clinging in the night as if you were measuring gold coins. I heard it. "" He said, ""I set aside some money for myself in a chest, and I am going to leave it to the one of you who is the most friendly toward me.

No one knew him, but his wife said she would satisfy him that way. When they were finally served, the worker asked for a night's lodging, but the miller objected, saying that it was too bad, but they had no other choice. The two said they would have no other lodging, and the other one went to the another. That one was soon brought back, but the other one had not entered the room. The girl lay down for a nap on the longsettle by the fire, but before she shut her eyes she took a good look at the traveler, who was sitting on the opposite side of the hearth, and espied a pair of man's trousers peeping out from under the gown. All inclination for sleep was now gone; however, with great self-command, she feigned it, closed her eyes, and even began to snore. On this the traveler got up, pulled out of his pocket a dead man's hand, fitted a candle to it, lighted the candle, and passed hand and candle several times before the servant girl's face, saying as he did so: ""Let all those who are asleep be asleep, and let those who are awake be awake. "" This done, he placed the light on the table, opened the outer door, went down two or three of the steps which led from the house to the road, and began to whistle for his companions. The girl (who had hitherto had presence of mind enough to remain perfectly quiet) now jumped up, rushed behind the ruffian, and pushed him down the steps. She then shut the door, locked it, and ran upstairs to try and wake the family, but without success: calling, shouting, and shaking were alike in vain. The poor girl was in despair, for she heard the traveler and his comrades outside the house. So she ran down again, and seized a bowl of blue (i. e. , skimmed milk), and threw it over the hand and candle; after which she went upstairs again, and awoke the sleepers without any difficulty. The landlord's son went to the window, and asked the men outside what they wanted. They answered that if the dead man's hand were but given them, they would go away quietly, and do no harm to anyone. This he refused, and fired among them, and the shot must have taken effect, for in the morning stains of blood were traced to a considerable distance. These circumstances were related to my informant, Mr. Charles Wastell, in the spring of 1861, by an old woman named Bella Parkin, who resided close to High Spital, and was actually the daughter of the courageous servant girl. Narrative 2 Two magicians, having come to lodge in a public house with a view to robbing it, asked permission to pass the night by the fire, and obtained it. When the house was quiet, the servant girl, suspecting mischief, crept downstairs and looked through the keyhole. She saw the men open a sack, and take out a dry, withered hand. They anointed the fingers with some unguent, and lighted them. Each finger flamed, but the thumb they could not light; that was because one of the household was not asleep. The girl hastened to her master, but found it impossible to arouse him. She tried every other sleeper, but could not break the charmed sleep. At last, stealing down into the kitchen, while the thieves were busy over her master's strongbox, she secured the hand, blew out the flames, and at once the whole household was aroused.   Narrative 3 One dark night, when all was shut up, there came a tap at the door of a lone inn in the middle of a barren moor. The door was opened, and there stood without, shivering and shaking, a poor beggar, his rags soaked with rain, and his hand white with cold. He asked piteously for a lodging, and it was cheerfully granted him; there was not a spare bed in the house, but he could lie on the mat before the kitchen fire, and welcome. So this was settled, and everyone in the house went to bed except the cook, who from the back kitchen could see into the large room through a pane of glass let into the door. She watched the beggar, and saw him, as soon as he was left alone, draw himself up from the floor, seat himself at the table, extract from his pocket a brown withered human hand, and set it upright in the candlestick. He then anointed the fingers, and applying a match to them, they began to flame. Filled with horror, the cook rushed up the back stairs, and endeavored to arouse her master and the men of the house.

It happened, that a farmer was cutting hay in the vicinity of the Brandelbach Forest. The wolf came in and stood just outside the door, growling and showing no fear. The farmer spoke to him, and asked whether he was hungry.

The gauntlet, gloves, helmet, and spurs were (as is often the case in monumental erections of Elizabethan date) suspended over the tomb. What chiefly attracted my attention was the color of the gloves, which was red. The old woman who acted as my cicerone, seeing me look at them, said, ""Aye, miss, those are Bloody Baker's gloves; their red color comes from the blood he shed. "" This speech awakened my curiosity to hear more, and with very little pressing I induced my old guide to tell me the following strange tale: The baker family had formerly large possessions in Cranbrook, but in the reign of Edward VI great misfortunes fell on them; by extravagance and dissipation they gradually lost all their lands, until an old house in the village (now used as the poor- house) was all that remained to them. The sole representative of the family remaining at the accession of Queen Mary was Sir Richard Baker. He had spent some years abroad in consequence of a duel; but when, said my informant, Bloody Queen Mary reigned, he thought he might safely return, as he was a Papist. When he came to Cranbrook he took up his abode in his old house. He only brought one foreign servant with him, and these two lived alone. Very soon strange stories began to be whispered respecting unearthly shrieks having been heard frequently to issue at nightfall from his house. Many people of importance were stopped and robbed in the Glastonbury woods, and many unfortunate travelers were missed and never heard of more. Richard Baker still continued to live in seclusion, but he gradually repurchased his alienated property, although he was known to have spent all he possessed before he left England. But wickedness was not always to prosper. He formed an apparent attachment to a young lady in the neighborhood, remarkable for always wearing a great many jewels. He often pressed her to come and see his old house, telling her he had many curious things he wished to show her. She had always resisted fixing a day for her visit, but happening to walk within a short distance of his house, she determined to surprise him with a visit. Her companion, a lady older than herself, endeavored to dissuade her from doing so, but she would not be turned from her purpose. They knocked at the door, but no one answered them; they, however, discovered it was not locked, and determined to enter. At the head of the stairs hung a parrot, which, on their passing, cried out: Peepoh, pretty lady, be not too bold, Or your red blood will soon run cold. And cold did run the blood of the adventurous damsel when, on opening one of the room doors, she found it filled with the dead bodies of murdered persons, chiefly women. Just then they heard a noise, and on looking out of the window saw Bloody Baker and his servant bringing in the murdered body of a lady.

It was purely out of curiosity that she came here, to see what was there. "" So she went there and saw the wild boar, who was sadly moaning and groaning, and by and by three hounds came running in and began to lap the ale out of a vessel. She cried out and complained to the Judge King, that he didn't grant her request yet, and told him she must go immediately back, to make him some supper, and make him good supper.

When the big dog came home the pot-o'-lithian greyhound broke his bone and died, and the dog lay down outside the house-door, too, and the big red dog came and begged for his life. The farmer wanted to kill him, but knew that the greyhound would only get in his way, and keep on declining, so he brought him home instead of killing him. The greyhound lived for some time, and was loved by everyone, so the wolf thought that he could not lose him, and he brought him home. The next day he led him and his family to a great forest where the elephant lived. The people were very grateful to the dog for his food, and ordered that all the remains of the meat be taken home by him. The farmer saw no need to do so, as his sons would be able to eat the same. So he kept some of the meat for his own family and lived a long time with them.

THE APPLICATION Industry and application to business makes amends for the want of a quick and ready wit. Hence it is, that the victory is not always to the strong, nor the race to the swift. Men of fine parts are apt to despise the drudgery of business; but by affecting to show the superiority of their genius, upon many occasions, they run into too great an extreme the other way; and the administration of their affairs is ruined through idleness and neglect. What advantage has a man from the fertility of his invention, and the vivacity of his imagination, unless his resolutions are executed with a suitable and uninterrupted rapidity? In short, your men of wit and fire, as they are called, are often times sots, slovens, and lazy fellows; they are generally proud and conceited to the last degree; and in the main, not the fittest persons for either conversation or business. -- Such is their vanity, they think the sprightliness of their humor inconsistent with a plain sober way of thinking and speaking, and able to atone for all the little neglects of their business and person. But the world will not be thus imposed upon: the man who would gain the esteem of others, and make his own fortune, must be one that carries his point effectually, and finishes his course without swerving and loitering. Men of dull parts, and slow apprehension, assisted by a continued diligence, are more likely to attain this, than your brisk retailers of wit, with their affected spleen and indolence. And, if business be but well done, no matter whether it be done by the sallies of a refined wit, or the considering head of a plain plodding man.",0.4961694150393551,0.596169415039355,-0.1,0.0

He remained that way a week.

Then my father persuaded the mother to send a messenger to a doctor in the north near Ramsey ""doing charms,"" to see if she couldn't get Robby back. As the messenger was returning, the mother stepped out of the house to relieve him, and when she went into the house again her own Robby was there. As soon as Robby came to himself all right, he said a little woman and a little boy had followed him, and that just as he got home he was conscious of being taken away by them, but he didn't know where they came from nor where they took him.

It was firmly believed that the hills were full of fairies, ""romping and carousing within,"" and that they carried off children and robbed milk and butter. The sprites could exercise malignant power on infants especially before baptism, stealing the handsome ones and replacing them by puny withered changelings. The only way to get rid of these was to set a pot on the fire and threaten to boil the fairy child, who then vanishes and the real child was brought back. Women who die in childbirth are believed to have been carried off to fairyland. I met everywhere, from Ballycastle to Inishbofin, beliefs as to the existence of changelings. Lady Wilde gives several from Inishark which seem to be good local tales. [Note 1] I must only give the shortest condensation of the beliefs. An old woman came into a house and looked at a child without saying ""God bless you""; it got ill, a strange ""wise woman"" told the parents that it had been changed and directed them to get a bit of the old woman's cloak. This made the elf sneeze and the true child was brought back. A man saw the fairies carrying off a boy, and, signing the cross, rescued the infant. He found the mother weeping over the supposed corpse, which he made her throw into the fire, where it came to life and flew up the chimney. He then gave her the real baby. A man, whose young wife had long been childless, taunted her, and she soon after bore a lovely boy. One day to his horror it suddenly grew a long beard, and he beat his wife, at whose screams two red-capped women came and beat him till he asked pardon. The real child sent a tuft of rushes to the mother, and she was able to enter the fairy palace. An elder fairy then greeted her, and told her to select the most beautiful dress and then follow him to his own home. She did so, and was shown into a bed-chamber. The mistress of the house, discovering the changeling, called out, ""You shall have your little boy back again. "" The changeling told her to put on the most beautiful dress she might desire. Then saying, ""My dear Lisbeth,"" he led her to the bed, where there sat a beautiful girl perfectly human. He again asked her to choose the most beautiful dress, but this she could not afford. He then made her take off her clothes and put on the most beautiful dress she had seen. She found herself in a room where twelve other girls were also waiting for aned world.

""Well, I am going to die; I know I am. "" Forthwith the monkey went to his friend's, and said, ""Let me give you some. "" Then he wrung the meat out of the monkey's heart and ate it up.

Remember that the fairies are only tricking you; do not despise them because they have they own nature. Footnote: ""The Ant and the Grasshopper In the winter season, a commonwealth of ants was busily employed in the management and preservation of their corn; which they exposed to the air, in heaps, round about the avenues of their little country habitation. Some summer's rain fell that December in immense quantities, and when the ants had gone to pasture in the spring, and the lion lay stretched out to sleep in the shade, the grasshopper, who had lagged behind, took him away by the nose with his thorny spikes, and stuck him on his nose instead of letting him go when he was half asleep. As soon as he was awake, he tore his eyes away from the view and saw the ant, with the blood streaming from a wound in his side. ""Aha!"" said the ant, ""you are much fatigued. I see that you have killed the lion, and then you are going to kill me. "" ""What!"" exclaimed the lion. ""You are not very strong, and yet you are able to kill a lion. "" ""But I am much afraid of you, my lord, and would not dare to start off so soon as you do not injure anyone. "" ""What!"" exclaimed the king. ""Do not undertake this journey unless you are in form a stone. "" ""The stone is inclining to fall,"" replied the servant; and the king, observing that he was wearied and hasty, gave him leave to lie, and ordered his guards to stop any misconduct on his way. The shepherd, however, continued on his way, down the steep bank he went, and the king did not see him all the time, but only in part of his giant form. At last he came to a wide river, that seemed easy to cross, and then he drew his sword and prepared to start. The lion, however, questioned him as to the means of his coming, and when the servant told him he had made up his mind to go to that river, the king summoned his vassals and address them as follows: ""Who has been eating from my plate? Who has been drinking from my cup? It was a human mouth. "" When the king heard the changeling speak, all of them, save the king, believed that he was the old wise man, instead of whom they all turned out to be trows. Now when the king was forward with his discourse, the trows all departed as rapidly as they had come, but he stood still, and listened. It was not three days, as he had expected, but rather seven, so I made up the number by adding a devil. And as he asked the number, I divided it into three heads, viz. Cyprianus, Dr. Faustus, and Jacob Ramel. The last two parts are written in characters which are said to be Persian or Arabic, and also in ordinary characters. In this book are taught exorcising, laying and raising of spirits, and all that of which mention is made in the 5th book of Moses (XVIII: 10-12). Whether this book has been printed is uncertain, but manuscript copies of it are concealed here and there among the common people, who regard it as something sacred. Those who possess the book of Cyprianus need never want money; they can read the devil to them and from them, and no one can harm them, not even the devil himself. But whoever possesses the book cannot get rid of it; for whether he sells, burns or buries it, it will come back; and if a person cannot dispose of it before his death, it will go badly with him. The only method is, to write his name in it in his own blood, and lay it in a secret place in the church, together with four shillings clerk's fee. The following is the substance of a new scheme which was tried on an old minister: he was given a sum of money to grant whatever wishes he wished, and then a bench was set up in the middle of the field, whence he could see the flock passing by. While he was resting, a wolf swam across the stream and seized him by the hand, holding him beneath the water and screaming with pain. The old minister asked what was the matter with the wolf, and said that it had been the old wise man's flock. ""Yes,"" echoed the shepherd, ""it is exactly like the order you left.

One day when he was resting from his work on the bank in the sunshine he saw a brightly glistening white robe lying before him, delicate and translucent and entirely woven from feathers. At the place where the shoulders would fit on the wonderful robe there hung two wings. He eagerly picked it up, wanting to take it home and carefully put it away, when a beautiful girl appeared before him. She sobbed aloud and demanded the return of her robe. Hakurioo was at first not at all willing to give up his find. But then the girl said, amidst endless sobs and tears, that she was a heavenly goddess, and that she would have to remain miserably on earth as long as she did not have her feathery robe, that she had taken off while bathing, and which had thus wrongly come into his hands. Moved by compassion, the fisherman said, ""Very well, I will give your robe back to you, if in return you will dance the heavenly dance for me with which you daughters of heaven soar through the clouds. "" The maiden replied, ""Yes, Lord, that is what I want. "" The fisherman considered for a moment and said, ""You will not get your robe back until I have made you happy, and also have you dance the heavenly dance. "" With this the heavenly maiden grew angry and said, ""If you will not give me my robe, I will go to all the forests, woods and mountains, and tell all your companions and all my friends and all the animal kingdom that you are a coward.

"" And the emperor, thinking that the shepherd might sell the golden horses to the lions, commanded him to be pulled into the jungle and to become a werewolf. The wolf visited the shepherd every day and asked him the same question: ""Where are you going?"" The shepherd answered, ""I am going to Heckelstadt to our father, and have myself transformed into a werewolf. "" When the shepherd heard this, he took it up with him, and went into the jungle. Now the shepherd had the bush from before, and knowing what kind of wolf it was, he called out, ""Trine, watch out!"" Suddenly a wolf came out of the forest. The shepherd surrounded him and killed him. Adam and Eve looked at the bush and saw that it was a colt, and they gave it to the colt because it was old and lacked all respect for his master. When the shepherd brought the old colt back to Heckelstadt, he broke it in pieces and threw it out into the lake, so that it could serve to lesson some restraint and good sense in the vicinity of the castle. One evening, having gone to him for advice, he was surprised at his return to the castle. He stood before the window and asked for admittance. The servant asked him why he had been waiting there so long, and the hedgehog replied that he had been waiting for his time. ""I am glad to know that you are taking good care of yourself. Don't say anything to anybody. Remember my words, and keep these vows of mine strictly. "" The king promised to keep these promises, and ruled with him for many years.

The only description I can give you of it is, a very thin, bell-mouthed, beaker glass, deep and narrow, ornamented on the outside with fancy work of coloured glass, and may hold something more than a pint. Antient superstition may have contributed not a little to its preservation; but that it should not, in a more enlightened age, or in moments of conviviality (see the Ballad), meet with one gentle rap (and a gentle one would be quite sufficient for an ordinary glass of the same substance), is to me somewhat wonderful. Superstition, however, cannot be entirely eradicated from the mind at once. The late agent of the family had such a reverential regard for this glass, that he would not suffer any person to touch it, and but few to see it . When the family, or other curious people, had a desire to drink out of it, a napkin was held underneath, less any accident should befall it; and it is still carefully preserved in a case made on purpose.

The elder lady fears that if she tells the truth both she and her husband will have to go to the catloaferies. The brother cherishes a grudge against his wife, and will certainly kill her if he thinks she has told him the truth. The young lady asks him what he means. He says he has killed her brothers in a mysterious manner. This she must tell to calm her mother. The young lady asks if she might take a horse and ride home on it. She takes the horse, and rides home under the reign of terror. No one knows the number of the deceased, nor do they care.

The pastor of the village was the last pastor alive when I lived there, and he often preached in that house. The sole occupant was a woman of remarkable size, and eminent in strength, who kept watch over our little brother and us.

It was said that if a person could gain the elevation proposed, he or she would become suddenly and unexpectedly rich. The only difficulty was, that, as the well was stood for drinking, one had to stand still while one was standing, or else else to hold the thumb of faith tightly clenched in one's hand. It is also said that at one time the well had been frequented by many murderers of both mind and body.

At his approach they immediately fled to secure their garbs, and, taking upon themselves the form of seals, plunged immediately into the sea. But as the Shetlander perceived that one skin lay close to his feet, he snatched it up, bore it swiftly away, and placed it in concealment. On returning to the shore he met the fairest damsel that was ever gazed upon by mortal eyes, lamenting the robbery, by which she had become an exile from her submarine friends, and a tenant of the upper world. Vainly she implored the restitution of her property. The man had drunk deeply of love, and was inexorable; but he offered her protection beneath his roof as his betrothed spouse. The merlady, perceiving that she must become an inhabitant of the earth, found that she could not do better than accept of the offer. This strange attachment subsisted for many years, and the couple had several children. The Shetlander's love for his merwife was unbounded, but his affection was coldly returned. The lady would often steal alone to the desert strand, and, on a signal being given, a large seal would make his appearance, with whom she would hold, in an unknown tongue, an anxious conference. Years had thus glided away, when it happened that one of the children, in the course of his play, found concealed beneath a stack of corn a seal's skin; and, delighted with the prize, he ran with it to his mother.

The city had by that time expanded substantially, but many of its buildings lay buried in rubble. Vermin, especially rats, multiplied beneath the ruins of the destroyed buildings until no cellar and no food storage room was safe from their devastation. Neither cats, nor traps, nor poison could bring them under control, and the city's inhabitants felt forced to flee. A public meeting of the town council was held to decide once and for all whether to attempt continued but futile resistance against the animals or to simply abandon hope for ever finding safety in another city. There were spirited arguments back and forth when suddenly and unexpectedly a man stepped before the judge's bench and stated that he possessed the means to put an end to the city's plague. No one knew him, but his offer was accepted with loud acclaim. Everyone looked forward with fond anticipation to the next morning, when the promised rescue was to take place. In return for his deed the rescuer was to be paid a large sum of money. As the cock crowed the man did indeed enter at the gate. He was wearing an unusual hunting outfit and carrying a very large hunter's bag. He pulled from the bag a small black transverse flute, upon which he played mournful melodies. Hoards of rats and mice followed the flute's sound, emerging in great masses from their holes in every corner of every house in the city. They followed the flute player, who walked directly toward the Danube. There he stepped into a boat and -- continuing to play the flute -- rode to the middle of the stream. Irresistibly attracted to the music, the rats attempted to swim after him, but they all drowned in the river's raging current. Thus Korneuburg was saved. The piper now returned and asked for the agreed payment. Someone asked him who he was. ""I came here from Vienna,"" he said, ""because I heard of your need.

When any one asked him whence he came and whither he was directing his course, he was wont to answer: ""From Vendsyssel over Himmelsyssel southwards. "" He foretold, and said of a stone in Mae: ""A thorn shall grow through the fissure in the stone, and in the thorn a magpie shall build her nest, hatch her young, and afterwards fly away with them. "" And this came to pass as he had said. He further foretold that when the magpie was flown, there should be a great battle in Vendsyssel, and the greater part of the people perish. Afterwards the women should acquire the courage and heart of men and slay the enemy. But when he was asked what further should happen, he answered: ""Let the end follow. "" In Aalborg he foretold something to the town magistrate, which did not particularly please him, and for which he caused him to be scourged. He then foretold again, that like as his blood was running down his back, so should the magistrate's blood run over the streets of Aalborg. And it happened as he had said; for in a quarrel which arose in the town, the townsmen slew the magistrate in the street. Of Haseriisaa, which at that time did not flow through Aalborg, he foretold that a time should come when it should run through the town; which also took place as he had predicted.

Faust had commanded the building of the castle not only to provide himself with a magnificent residence, but also in an attempt to give the devil a task that he would be unable to fulfill, thus voiding the pact that ultimately would end with Faust's damnation. However, the devil proved equal to this task. In another attempt to frustrate the devil, Faust requested a bowling alley in the middle of the Danube River. This too was accomplished, and Faust miraculously was able to play at bowls on the surface of the water.

As the urgency of their business did not permit them to return, they took the child with them, and kept it till the next time they had occasion to visit Glenlivat. On their arrival they said nothing about the child, which they kept concealed. In the course of conversation, the mother took occasion to remark that the disease which had attacked the child the last time they were there had never left it, and she had not little hopes of its recovery.

""A persuasion prevails among the ignorant,"" says the author of a MS. history of Moray, that ""in a consumptive disease, the fairies steal away the soul, and put the soul of a fairy in the room of it. "" This belief prevails chiefly along the eastern coast of Scotland, where a practice, apparently of druidical origin, is used to avert the danger. In the increase of the March moon, withes of oak and ivy are cut, and twisted into wreaths or circles, which they preserve till next March. After that period, when persons are consumptive, or children hectic, they cause them to pass thrice through these circles. In other cases the cure was more rough, and at least as dangerous as the disease, as will appear from the following extract:-- There is one thing remarkable in this parish of Suddie, (in Isverness-shire,) which I think proper to mention. There is a small hill N. W. from the church commonly called Therdy Hill, or Hill of Therdie, as some term it; on the top of which there is a well, which I had the curiosity to view, because of the several reports concerning it. When children happen to be sick, and languish long in their malady, so that they almost turn skeletons, the common people imagine they are taken away (at least the substance) by spirits, called Fairies, and the shadow left with them; so, at a particular season in summer, they leave them all night themselves, watching at a distance, near this well, and this they imagine will either end or mend them; they say many more do recover than do not. Yea, an honest tenant who lives hard by it, and whom I had the curiosity to discourse about it, told me it has recovered some, who were about eight or nine years of age, and to his certain knowledge, they bring adult persons to it; for, as he was passing one dark night, he heard groanings, and, coming to the well, he found",0.6752201616883696,0.6752201616883696,0.0,0.0

According to tradition, the entire expense of erecting this noble edifice was defrayed by a tinker or pedlar residing in the parish named John Chapman, who, if the voice of the legend is to be believed, was marvelously provided for by Divine Providence. It is said that this tinker dreamed that if he went to London Bridge he would, to use the phraseology of a certain class of advertisements, ""hear of something greatly to his advantage. "" Nothing daunted by the difficulties of so long a journey five hundred years ago, when, not to utter a hint of railroads, even stage coaches had not been invented, the tinker heeded the voice of his good spirit, and went to London. After standing about the bridge for several hours -- some versions of the legend mention the traditional three days -- a man accosted him, and invited him to unfold the nature of his errand. With candor quite equal to his faith, John Chapman replied that he came there on the ""vain errand of a dream. "" Now it appears that the stranger was a dreamer also, but, unlike the tinker, he was neither superstitious nor imprudent. ""Alas! good friend,"" said he, ""if I had heeded dreams, I might have proved myself as very a fool as thou art, for 'tis not long since I dreamt that at a place called Swaffham in Norfolk dwelt John Chapman, a pedlar, who hath a tree at the back of his house, under which is buried a pot of money.

When the grandson noticed what his father had done, he took some tools and went down under the house. There he took a piece of board and began to carve it. When his father saw him and said to him, ""What are you doing, son?"" the boy replied to him, ""Father, I am making wooden plates for you and my mother when you are old. "" As the son uttered these words, tears gushed from the father's eyes.

A certain man and a merchant to boot had married a fair wife, a woman of perfect beauty and grace, symmetry and loveliness, of whom he was mad-jealous, and who contrived successfully to keep him from travel. At last an occasion compelling him to leave her, he went to the bird market and bought him for one hundred gold pieces a she-parrot which he set in his house to act as duenna, expecting her to acquaint him on his return with what had passed during the whole time of his absence; for the bird was kenning and cunning and never forgot what she had seen and heard. Now his fair wife had fallen in love with a young Turk, who used to visit her, and she feasted him by day and lay with him by night. When the man had made his journey and won his wish he came home; and, at once causing the parrot to be brought to him, questioned her concerning the conduct of his consort whilst he was in foreign parts. Quoth she, ""Thy wife hath a man friend who passed every night with her during thine absence. "" Thereupon the husband went to his wife in a violent rage, and bashed her with a bashing severe enough to satisfy anybody. The woman, suspecting that one of the slave girls had been tattling to the master, called them together and questioned them upon their oaths, when all swore that they had kept the secret, but that the parrot had not, adding, ""And we heard her with our own ears. "" Upon this the woman bade one of the girls set a hand-mill under the cage and grind therewith, and a second to sprinkle water through the cage roof, and a third to run about, right and left, flashing a mirror of bright steel through the livelong night. Next morning, when the husband returned home after being entertained by one of his friends, he bade bring the parrot before him, and asked what had taken place whilst he was away. ""Pardon me, O my master,"" quoth the bird, ""I could neither hear nor see aught by reason of the exceeding murk and the thunder and lightning which lasted throughout the night. "" As it happened to be the summer-tide the master was astounded and cried, ""But we are now in mid-Tammuz, and this is not the time for rains and storms. "" "" Ay, by Allah,"" rejoined the bird, ""I saw with these eyes what my tongue hath told thee. "" Upon this the man, not knowing the case nor smoking the plot, waxed exceeding wroth; and, holding that his wife had been wrongously accused, put forth his hand and pulling the parrot from her cage dashed her upon the ground with such force that he killed her on the spot.

The traveler begged to stay all night, but had to go away so early in the morning that if a mouthful of food were set ready for breakfast there was no need the family should be disturbed by her departure. The people of the house, however, arranged that a servant maid should sit up till the stranger was out of the premises, and then went to bed themselves. The girl lay down for a nap on the longsettle by the fire, but before she shut her eyes she took a good look at the traveler, who was sitting on the opposite side of the hearth, and espied a pair of man's trousers peeping out from under the gown. All inclination for sleep was now gone; however, with great self-command, she feigned it, closed her eyes, and even began to snore.

The king therefore stayed that night with Igerna and had the full enjoyment of her, for she was deceived with the false disguise which he had put on, and the artful and amorous discourses wherewith he entertained her. He told her he had left his own place besieged, purely to provide for the safety of her dear self, and the town she was in; so that believing all that he said, she refused him nothing which he desired. The same night therefore she conceived of most renowned Arthur, whose heroic and wonderful actions have justly rendered his name famous to posterity. In the meantime, as soon as the king's absence was discovered at the siege, his army unadvisedly made an assault upon the walls, and provoked the besieged count to a battle, who himself also, acting as inconsiderately as they, sallied forth with his men, thinking with such a small handful to oppose a powerful army, but happened to be killed in the very first brunt of the fight, and had all his men routed. The town also was taken; but all the riches of it were not shared equally among the besiegers, but every one greedily took what he could get, according as fortune or his own strength favoured him. After this bold attempt, came messengers to Igerna, with the news both of the duke's death, and of the event of the siege. But when they saw the king in the likeness of the consul, sitting close by her, they were struck with shame and astonishment at his safe arrival there, whom they had left dead at the siege; for they were wholly ignorant of the miracles which Merlin had wrought with his medicines. The king therefore smiled at the news, and embracing the countess, said to her, ""Your own eyes may convince you that I am not dead, but alive. But notwithstanding, the destruction of the town, and the slaughter of my men, is what very much grieves me; so that there is reason to fear the king's coming upon us, and taking us in this place. To prevent which, I will go out to meet him, and make my peace with him, for fear of a worse disaster. "" Accordingly, as soon as he was out of the town, he went to his army, and having put off the disguise of Gorlois, was now Uther Pendragon again. When he had a full relation made to him how matters had succeeded, he was sorry for the death of Gorlois, but rejoiced that Igerna was now at liberty to marry again. Then he returned to the town of Tintagel, which he took, and in it, what he impatiently wished for, Igerna herself.

I therefore promise you a reward"" He then gave her a ring and called for his servant, and commanded him to drive Fortunio home. And when the servant entered the inner room he found Fortunio sitting with his face to the wall in deep meditation, as the cuckoo does with its young. Then he said to him: ""Why do you sit there in deep meditation, Fortunio?"" ""As of my life,"" answered the cuckoo. ""You see, wife, since my first I came to you, I have been your cuckoo; and, since your own young, I have cared for you and fed you. Now, since you have brought your husband home, I will depart; but come to the cock, and I will return to you. "" If you will therefore obey and lend me your roost, I will give it back to you free of charge, and furthermore I will give you the young of your son. "" This rooster was given to Fortunio as a prize in a cricket match, and it rowed over the fields until it was killed. Now they went on a little further, when some noise in the river made the rooster begin to crow again. ""My son,"" said the rooster, ""is married now, and has many children. What will you do with all these children? You did not choose them, but others did. "" Many years afterward, when Frau Waitio was in trouble and had sent for Fortunio to help her, Fortunio said to her, ""Mother, may the good fortune you desire be with you always!

""Verily,"" in the words of an old chronicler, ""it was a rare and miraculous frenzy.

She should then return to her own city, whence she could get marriage with a German man. She should hide the child and go with the others. One should not ask why a child was hidden in a milk-pile in the first instance, nor should one wonder that a child should be buried in a such a place. The old woman who ran the miller's house had had such a baby and hid it in a milk-pile, thinking that if he came and asked for it he would think that he had stolen it and give it to the devil.

Caught by a sudden need for money, he thought of a wealthy Jew, Melchizedek by name, who lived in Alexandria. But Melchizedek had a reputation for miserliness, and he would never voluntarily surrender the vast sum needed by Saladin, nor was the Sultan prepared to take the money by force. At last Saladin devised a plan whereby he would embarrass the wealthy Jew, who would then redeem himself with money. Accordingly, Saladin summoned Melchizedek to his palace, then stated, ""Men speak highly of your wisdom. What conclusion have you reached concerning the ways of God? Which of the three great religions is the truly authentic one? Judaism, Christianity, or Islam?"" Sensing that with this question Saladin was seeking to lead him into an unwinnable quarrel and thus gain advantage over him, Melchizedek answered, ""That is an excellent question, my lord. I can best explain my views on the subject with the following story:"" I have heard that there was once a wealthy man whose most prized possession was a precious ring. He bequeathed this ring to one of his sons, and by this sign, the latter was known as the head of family. Succeeding generations followed this tradition, with the principal heir always inheriting the cherished ring from his father. But, to make a long story short, the ring finally came into the possession of a man who had three sons, each the equal of the others in obedience, virtue, and worthiness. Unwilling to favor one son over the others, the father had a master artisan make two copies of the valued ring, and he bequeathed a ring to each son. Following the father's death, each son laid claim to the deceased man's title and estate, showing the inherited ring as proof. However, a careful inspection of the three rings could not reveal which of them was the authentic one, so the three sons' claims remain unresolved. The same is true with the three great religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The adherents of each religion consider themselves to be the legitimate heirs of God's truth. But as was the case with the rings, their claims too remain unresolved. Saladin, recognizing that the Jew had escaped his trap, decided to ask him directly for a loan. Melchizedek gladly provided him with the sum he needed.

Mother and children agreed to this, and they dried their young ones on the branches of a nearby willow tree. After they had come back from the wedding they went to bed. Old-wise people said that the boy brought back the drippings from his horse, while the one stayed awake and kept looking for a place where the drippings had fallen onto the tree. He finally found it, and was very happy. He tied all the drippings onto his horse and rode away with them. In the evening he returned and took them to the woman, who had only brought her young ones home from the wedding. She took them to bed and made preparations to leave them there. The boy said to his mother, ""Mother, I am going to stay awake until late at night and keep watch on the peeping Tom who is going to betray me. "" ""Don't!"" said the mother. ""That man is my son, and he will never betray you. "" Then the boy went to bed and went to sleep. He had to wake up early in the morning to go to the wedding. He drew his sword from its sheath and sprang into the crowd that was following him. Finally he found his way to the knight. ""Son,"" said he, ""are you going to marry the princess?"" ""Yes,"" said the boy, ""she is my wife, and I will never marry her. "" Then the knight said to him, ""What will you do?"" ""I will kill her,"" said the boy. ""Then you will have a good time.

He saw them all hanging their clothes so they would be free for the goose. He thought to himself, ""That is easy. I will pick out the green weeds from among the wheat.

""We will see about that,"" he replied. Weeping and disappointed, she returned home. Some time later she received a call from her husband. She arrived home with her children and was about to leave. ""Good evening, honey,"" said the man's voice. ""What is the meaning of this?"" ""Honey, the man is still alive. Take care of him. I will die. "" ""Oh, sure,"" said the woman. When the husband's sickness finally took its toll, he became very feeble. When his wife was in need of him, he would call out loudly, but he did not have the strength to speak. When he was being comforted, he would beg her to tell what was wrong with him. One day a young nun was helping her mother with some work. The mother tended the sick man until he felt better, then she tended her son until he felt better. When the nun left to help her mother, the son asked his father what was wrong with him. The father told him to follow the nun. While he was walking following the nun, she suddenly collapsed. He helped her until she could stand. Then he asked her how she was. She answered, ""Oh, I'm good. Don't be afraid. I'm sure that nothing is wrong with me. "" Then she gave him a slap on the back, told him to say thank you, and went away. When her husband found out what had happened to his wife, he beat her terribly. However, the nun saved his life. Whenever the man returned home from work, the woman used to pull out a leaf from the nun's hair and slap him. The leaf grew into a large tree. The following day the big tree had a small branch, and the little branch became a large tree. The man stood in as great a dilemma as the woman did, between his conscience and his lust. He could not choose between the two. Every time he looked at a beautiful girl, his conscience told him to avoid her. He finally decided to entice one of his neighbor's daughters to stay with him and give him a room. He said, ""If you succeed in getting one of the girl's sisters to stay with you, you will have my friendship. "" The following evening he arrived at his destination. He began to look around him, wondering what might be the need for all the planning that went into his getting the daughter to stay. He saw a well and a little pot of gold lying on the ground. He decided to spend the night there and to bathe his body in the water. In the morning he would depart. A short time later, the daughter came to him and asked him what he was doing there. ""I am looking for a girl,"" he said, ""and I think I know who she is. "" ""Then let us go to sleep,"" said the daughter, ""and continue to look for her in the morning.

His wife observed this, and she insisted that he tell her why he had laughed, for she was very curious. He would have liked to tell her, in order to keep her quiet, but he was not allowed to, for it would have cost him his life. Therefore he refused, and she became all the more impatient and angry heaping many curses and accusations upon him and saying that he always kept secrets from her. Thus it continued from one day to the next. This saddened the man so much that he walked around with his head sunk in sorrow trying to think of a way to change the situation. He wandered into the farmyard and saw the rooster in great distress with his head standing on end, and unable to do anything about it. The other animals began to pity him, and he swore to himself that he would help the rooster if only he would point to a field where he had lived since ancient times. The rooster finally pointed to a field, and the man said, ""Then, sire, I will give you a field in which to live!"" With this the rooster crowed, and with one swift flight it brought him before the man and said, ""Urban is dead, long live Urban!"" Then the man, thoroughly angered, flew after the rooster and struck it down with a blow on the back of the head. Immediately the miserable bird jumped up and fled.

The stone part, which is the chief distinction, was laid with many holes, which are still visible along the course of the course. Most remarkable of all was the fact that the connection was complete across the entire course. The king ordered a detailed report made on the cathedrals construction, and the following report was received at the king's court: 1. The cathedrals tower spans several hundred feet above the street. No, no, it does not rise to the heavens exactly, but it rises perfectly straight, as is best. The length of its arched portion is five hundred and fifty feet, and the sloping part extends to the city. Therefore it must rise to greater or lesser distances. Of course this news greatly alarmed the king. He immediately ordered a detailed report made at his own expense, requesting the auditor of the palace of streets to bring back the exact distances. 2. The distances stated by the auditor were greatly to the disappointment of both the king and the emperor; for the length of the tower was much greater than had originally been supposed. But still more to the disappointment of all was the fact that the arched part was smooth and flat, whereas the portion connected with it was rougher and crumbly. This the emperor would have known if he had taken into consideration the state of some of the bricks which made up the city of Viborg. These, it seems, were of an unusual color. A careful inquiry was accordingly made into the matter by a leading dealer in silvers. This showed that one of every hundred bricks was a color quite different from the rest. Thus the emperor knew that he was dealing with a strange person, who was sure to disappoint him if he could. At the same time he noticed a strange stone on the top of the tower.

"" Seeing that he had no other choice, he went to the countess and crushed down his hand, and threw it into the water, crying, ""The wretched man is drowned. "" A while after this, the countess gave birth to a son who was baptized with success, and who became king. How did he treat him when he was baptized? How was he paid? When he had grown up, he bought a good cap, and he put it on his head. Then he pressed his forelock against the wet hem of his cap, and turned it around. The cap was put into his mouth and expired, and he had to put it back on. A bald man had a cap put on his head once, and he pressed his forelock against it. The countess told him that her father had intended to keep the cap on his head and die, but that he had slipped his cap off instead.

The seal uttered a cry of admiration, and rushed out; but, being unable to carry the considerable weight of the ram, it rolled about on the ground, and was no larger when it had disappeared. A little later the same thing occurred again. A servant of the chamberlain, having accidentally killed a fly, took it to the chamberlain, who prescribed a poison, and sent the devil to carry it to the gatepost.

She was buried at Scotland Wells, where her tombstone is still to be seen. Poor Mrs. Erskine had one terrible experience. The minister, a widower when he married Marion Halcro, was deeply attached to his young wife, and bitter was his anguish when, a few months after the marriage, she was cut off by a short illness. Mr. Erskine resolved that her trinkets and jewellery should be buried with her, and a valuable ring was left upon her finger. When John Carr, village carpenter, and sexton of Chirnside Parish Church, came to screw down the coffin lid, the minister, gazing on the features of his beloved wife, thought he saw the lips quiver. Every available test was vainly tried in the fond hope that life had not departed. But Carr had seen the jewellery, examined the bracelets, and had even tried whether the ring would slip off without difficulty, for he thought it a pity that such beautiful articles should be lost. To save himself subsequent labour and time, the nails were loosely screwed, and in late afternoon at the graveyard, consulting the feelings of the bereaved husband, the earth was lightly thrown in, the considerate sexton remarking that he could finish the work better in daylight. At night Carr returned to the burial ground, quickly removed the earth, and opened the coffin. The ring was first sought, but it refused to leave its place. Taking his knife, the operator placed the finger on the edge of the coffin and proceeded to amputation. With the opening of a vein vitality was restored, and Mrs. Erskine uttered a piercing shriek. Carr yelled and fled, leaving the lady to get out of the grave as best she might. Weak and cold as a corpse, she found her way home, but even at the manse her troubles were not over.

While he stood helpless, Mrs. Erskine, shivering in her grave clothes, slipped past and hurried to the study, where there was a fire. Stimulants were administered, and the bed, warmed with hot bricks, soon restored her to comfort, and she was able to relate in detail her terrible experiences, through all of which she had been perfectly conscious. She told of her great effort to speak when her husband was looking at her in her coffin; of Carr's examination of the jewellery; and of her calculating on the sexton's return to the grave.

The swiftest messengers were sent hurrying to fetch the best doctors from every country under the sea, but it was all of no use; the queen grew rapidly worse instead of better. Everyone had almost given up hope, when one day a doctor arrived who was cleverer than the rest, and said that the only thing that would cure her was the liver of an ape. Now apes do not dwell under the sea, so a council of the wisest heads in the nation was called to consider the question how a liver could be obtained. At length it was decided that the turtle, whose prudence was well known, should swim to land and contrive to catch a living ape and bring him safely to the ocean kingdom. It was easy enough for the council to entrust this mission to the turtle, but not at all so easy for him to fulfil it. However, he swam to a part of the coast that was covered with tall trees, where he thought the apes were likely to be; for he was old, and had seen many things.

They joined in the harder labour of the house; and, as their only reward, claimed a share of the warmth from the evening hearth -- at which they would appear as soon as the doors were shut, warming their aged limbs, and eating, meanwhile, little frogs ( ranunculos ), which they drew from their bosoms and toasted on the embers. In the same manner, the Pixies of Dartmoor, notwithstanding their darker character, aided occasionally in household work. A cottage at Belstone, near Oakhampton, is pointed out as having been a favourite scene of their labours. It was common to find great additions made to the ""web"" of cloth, morning after morning; and the Pixies were frequently heard working at the loom all through the night. Plates of honey and cream, but especially a basin of pure water, must be regularly placed for them in such houses as they frequent; and it is not safe to add a more valuable reward. A washerwoman was one morning greatly surprised on coming down stairs to find all her clothes neatly washed and folded. She watched the next evening, and observed a Pixy in the act of performing this kind office for her; but she was ragged and mean in appearance, and Betty's gratitude was sufficiently great to induce her to prepare a yellow petticoat and a red cap for the obliging Pixy. She placed them, accordingly, by the side of the basin of water; and watched for the result. The Pixy, after putting them on, disappeared through the window, apparently in great delight. But Betty was ever afterwards obliged to wash all her clothes herself. At another farm on the borders of the moor, the inhabitants were disturbed at dead of night by the loud noise of a flail at work in the barn; and in the morning a quantity of corn, which had been left in ear, was found threshed. On the ensuing night, watch was kept by the farmer, who perceived six ""sprites,"" of the smallest imaginable size, enter the barn, and perform the same kind office as before. Their dress, however, was ragged and dirty -- and the farmer had better clothes prepared for them, which he placed where they might readily find them. In the meantime, he told his neighbours of his good luck -- who, less kind-hearted than himself, stationed themselves in the barn with their guns, behind some unthreshed corn. They had not watched long when the Pixies entered; and, delighted with their new clothes, commenced their usual dance all song -- in the midst of which the farmers who were in watch fired on them.

These often have been dammed up, but the rain always washes them open again. The floods of blood streamed together and finally poured into the River Besse. Karl fought and prevailed. In the evening the mountain opened up, received him and his exhausted warriors, and then closed its walls. However, the stories about these events contradict one another. According to some, Karl, pursued by the enemy, fled to Odin's Mountain where he beseeched the Godhead to take him and all of his people into the mountain. The mountain opened up, and Karl went inside with his entire army, whereupon the crevice closed behind them. The king rests from all his heroic deeds in this mountain. He has promised to come out every seven or every hundred years. When the time comes, one can hear weapons rattling in the air, the neighing and hooting of horses, and the sounds of drums and bugles. Karl the Fifth and his warriors are leaving their underground home. The procession goes to Glis Spring, where the horses drink, and then continues its round and finally returns to the mountain. Sunday's children who were born between two churches have often seen the procession. Most of the soldiers are maimed; the one has lost an arm, another a leg or an ear. Many have gaping wounds. One time some people went to Odin's Mountain and heard the sound of drums but did not see anything. Then a wise man asked them, one after another, to look through the circle he had made by bending his arm against his body. They did this and saw a band of soldiers drilling with their weapons, coming and going from Odin's Mountain. Inside the mountain they grow oats for their horses. ""The Quint"" throws out all the oats that he does not need for his horses. Every day the warriors clean and thresh oats and pile up large stores in their chambers. Once a swineherd noticed that one of his sows always ran away from the herd when he brought them to Odin's Mountain, and she always returned fat and full. One day he followed her. She ran through a hole into the mountain where there was a great store of oats. Every seven years the mountain opens up, and anyone who happens to find the opening that leads inside is very fortunate, because great treasures lie within the mountain. But the passageway is only open for a fourth of an hour, and anyone who does not return to the outside before this time is up will have to remain there until the next seven years have passed. However, those whose fate it is to stay there do not grow any older while they are inside the mountain. They remain just as they were at the moment that the mountain closed. Until just a few years ago no one would approach the mountain without shuddering for fear of Karl the Fifth. Children who collected nuts and strawberries there were warned by their parents, ""Be careful that the Quint doesn't get you!""

After a while, however, the anger died down, and the fathers found they were quite easy to deal with. Besides, there was only one thing to be done to lock the door against the three men.

As he proceeded a cave opened beneath the altar, and a human, bare-headed and clad in silk, entered and surveyed the state of the town. With a gentle steps he thence proceeded to the court of Vitalis, who received him with acclamation, and joyfully entertained him for several hours together. In return for his kind treatment she was ever afterwards to make Vitalis a conspicuous pledge, and confirm his fidelity with a signature written in his own blood. One day after their conversation, the hyena, who was present, signified to the emperor that he should immediately dispatch a messenger to fetch up the wife of one of his subjects, who might succeed in breaking the monarch's habit of attending to his own affairs, if he could not immediately discover where the missing jewel lay. The emperor immediately ordered his messager to hasten with a two-horse troop, and when the rat was led before him, he gave him such a surprise, that he would have awarded him the crown had he remained silent. But Vitalis was not dismayed at the discovery of the trap, and proceeded to carry out his agreement with the rat, as soon as the latter had delivered his consent, and given his name and charge to the person who then came forward and claimed the prize. On entering the king's palace he was received with acclamation, and shown in fine style the house, where he was shown into a large room, with a long table before them, in which sat a monkey of extraordinary size and build, and surrounded by all the costume and carriage of a friendly prince. But though the monkey was conspicuous by his exceeding swiftness, nothing seemed to please him, till at last he was invited to take his seat at the table. At the end of the meal, while the ants were dividing their bread and butter, one of them stood at the door and listened to what was said, and found out that Vitalis was alive and well, and consequently had to eat the whole of his bread and butter. So he stood still and when the king returned from his travel, was astonished to find his old friend standing near him, and moreover, that the bread and butter was substituted for the missing property. As soon as he had received the glad tidings of his missing property, he immediately moved to Viterbo, and began to fill his bags with grain, hoping to find again at length in the imperial store. But whatever chance luck may have offered, it availed him little, for through the destruction of the butterfly all hope of a profit was severed; and with a severe stroke of the knife he closed up the hole, and filled the pots again with water, intending to restore his former property, but with the butterfly instead of the stock. But when he had finished refilling his pots, and was about to return to the stock, he was astonished to hear a blue butterfly flew out and interrupted his spell by returning to its nest by the pot. There he found a beautiful female butterfly, whom he married, and who contributed to his prosperity accordingly. But although he gave her all that she needed, she was never able to fill his appetite, and his patience was always ruined by a failure to satisfy his blue butterfly.

The old woman, thus left alone, being unable to maintain herself, resolved to live under her son's roof. Naturally enough, the son treated her with respect and kindness, but her daughter-in-law, who had a tongue which might goad a man to fury, seized every opportunity of ill-treating her. At every turn she would give her a sound scolding, and often ordered her out of doors. Small wonder was it, then, that the mother, unable to bear the severity of her son's wife, made up her mind to quit his house for her daughter's. When the son heard this, though cut to the quick, he was at a loss as to what he should do to remedy matters, for he was a hen-pecked husband. That night sleep fled from his eyes, and, as he lay awake pondering over this unfortunate state of affairs, a beautiful idea struck him, and he was anxiously waiting till it dawned to carry it out. Early in the morning, while his wife was yet sleeping, he called his mother aside, and giving her a bag bade her fill it with stones and when parting to make much ado and carry it away with her, pretending the while there was something valuable in it. When the time came she, with sufficient tact, wished them all manner of good and together with her bag full of treasures, wended her way to her daughter's abode. Scarce had she gone a few yards, when the son rated his wife soundly, and opened her eyes to her folly in allowing his mother to depart for, said he, ""You saw ber carrying away that bag of gold, and now she would leave it all to my sister, and we would be such losers by it. "" When the wife heard this, her sorrow and mortification know no bounds, and she resolved to bring the old woman home at any cost. So, on the morrow, she prepared some rice-cakes and other sweetmeats and, with all possible haste, she went to her whom she had so cruelly driven away and with artful language coaxed her back. For, had she not a bag full of glittering gold! Ever afterwards she swallowed her wrath in silence and treated her with",0.6635319860677907,0.6635319860677907,0.0,0.0

Now they lived in a room all together, and the parrot had a little perch by the side, and the frog had a little perch by the window. One day the frog made such a entreaty and explanation as to why he should be so late for his perch, and the parrot told him just now how she resolved to divert him for the purpose of watching him. So the parrot used meekly to obey the injunction, and prepare myself for death, that I might live longer in his house. I will do better and finish my business here, and permit you to kill me when I have served my guest to your face. "" When the time came, the frog jumped out of his skin, but when the parrot saw what he had done, she laughed so loudly that she burst. The frog was very angry at her rashness and folly, and told her so, and told the emperor all that had happened to him and his wife, and how the parrot had laughed at his fear and his wife's foolishness. So the emperor commanded his coach to be made ready, and he took the old man with him, and they drove to the spot, for he wished to see for himself whether the parrot's story was true; but when they reached the place only one stem was left. So the emperor desired his attendants to cut him a flute, and, when they had finished cutting him they took him back to the palace, and placed him on the platform. But when the young woman heard what had happened she hid the flute, and pretended that she had found it when she went into the stall. Now in the stall she found a young wolf who was not yet dead, and who she took into her room. After a while the wolf showed himself again, and he played a flute upon which he repeated the last stanza: Now the emperor is king of the countriesmen; Now the wolf is king of the countrymen. The young woman, pretending that she heard nothing, ran out into the hall and up to the bedchamber. Her sister met her here, and she told her what she had heard. She hid the flute, and played it upon her bed-chamber door. Then the emperor commanded his chamberlain to bring him the young wolf who had died in the castle, and who must be named something like Siegfried or Aleksandr Afanasovitch , and who was supposed to have played a lesser flute or piped somewhat beneath the sound of a donkey. The emperor commanded the chamberlain to tell the king, and when the chamberlain brought him the boy, he said, ""Please, father, to honor me for my task. "" Whereupon the emperor gave him a shirt with his own blood added on it, and said, ""And honor me also for doing good and not harming anyone.

Several times it happened that after driving his herd home he discovered that one of the sheep was missing. All searching was in vain. They were lost and they remained lost. Watching more carefully, he saw a large wolf creep out of the forest thicket and seize a lamb. Angrily he chased after him, but the enemy was too fleet. Before he could do anything about it, the wolf had disappeared with the lamb. The next time he took an expert marksman with him. The wolf approached, but the marksman's bullets bounced off him. Then it occurred to the hunter to load his weapon with the dried pith from an elder bush. The next day he got off a shot, and the robber ran howling into the woods. The next morning the shepherd met an old neighbor woman with whom he was not on the best of terms. Noticing that she was limping, he asked her: ""Neighbor, what is wrong with your leg? It does not want to go along with you. "" ""What business is it of yours?"" she answered, hurrying away. The shepherd took note of this. This woman had long been suspected of practicing evil magic. People claimed to have seen her on the Heuberg in Swabia, the Köterberg, and also on the Hui near Halberstadt. He reported her. She was arrested, interrogated, and flogged with rod of alder wood, with which others suspected of magic, but who had denied the charges, had been punished. She was then locked up in chains. But suddenly the woman disappeared from the prison, and no one knew where she had gone. Some time later the poor, unsuspecting shepherd saw the hated wolf break out of the forest once again.

Whoever wanted to go had to write a prayer that would protect them against being witches. The following night, while the people were asleep, the guests would silently collect in the churchyard where a crocodile was lying stretched out on the ground. He had been there for a long time and nobody had seen him. The elders were so concerned they had a man go to the place and hang himself on the crocodile's tail so that it would not fall off. The villagers were told of this event, and they wondered why no one had heard of it. One day they were at the place, when a crocodile turned himself into a man and called out: ""People, there is a man turning himself into a woman, a fellow who has eaten a large quantity of flesh, thus giving rise to the fear that he will suck more milk than she. "" This struck fear into the woman's heart, and she cried out in wrath, ""Will anyone be deceived by my crying and not watch out?"" Then the husband went out and hung himself on the crocodile's tail, and the woman did the same. Soon thereafter the lord of Eckhardtsberg, wishing to get a closer look at the crocodile, mounted on his horse and rode down to the spot.

In due time the father returned and thenceforth acted as his own guardian and adviser. He taught the girl all that he knew, and taught her not to get her wish until she had actually seen the places where the fairy children had driven the dragon away. The girl wanted to drive him away again, so one day she put a magic mute in his mouth and set it on the dunghill. When she tried to speak, he forgot what he had said and spoke ill of her. She went to an attorney to see a lawyer, and testified that Weinberg was hers and she should give her back her father's property. The attorney said that he would try his best to help her, but that he would not speak to her unless she promised him two things: (1) that he should not tell anyone what he had said; and (2) that he should not drive the mute into the river. The girl said to him, ""If I give you the things I have obtained by stealing, you will burn with anger and revenge yourself, for I have all that I need for my own mouth.

She took it and put it in her mouth, and what she said is this: ""Now go and shut the door, for that I will give you the shillings that you have stolen from me. "" Then she went and shut the door. Now she should have returned home, but she had gone to the neighbor's house and told the woman there that her husband was dead and that her child was missing. The woman there hid the mute in her cellar and waited for the day when her husband should come home, but none came. So she went to her father and told him what had happened. Then the father could send a messenger and have the mute carried to him. The messenger rode along and shouted, ""What is the neighbor doing alive? Let him come to him. "" Then the father could send the mute to the forest and have him taught words than he could utter. So the messenger rode back and told what had happened to the king. Then the king sought the messenger and brought him, but the man had gone away. So the king summoned his son and said, ""What have you done with our son?"" As the son heard the king's question, he made the wise decision and asked his father what he meant by it. The father answered, ""When a man has committed an evil deed and is trying to cover it up, then his own good character is called into question. I am doing everything in my power to make sure that this doer of evil does not get to eat at my table once more.

Then the messenger rode his horse to the top of the pass and whispered in the king's ear: ""Look, the eagle is attacking the ravens. "" The king looked and saw a great flock of ravens flying toward him. But the king did not wish to be attacked by the birds. Therefore, he sent messengers throughout the land and asked the chiefs of the various tribes if they could possibly devise a way to protect him from the ravens. Finally they decided that the only thing that would do was for the messenger to untie the noose from around the king's neck. The king then had the boy brought to him and had him untied, and the ravens flew away. Now the messenger was sent to the king again and told what had happened to the emperor. The king responded by saying, ""What have you done with my son?"" The messenger replied, ""What can I do, for the emperor has now seen what has happened to my child.

She replied that she was willing enough, but there was no pan in the house, and if he wished for pancakes, he had better go and borrow one from the neighbor. He complied, and at dinner he ate as rapidly as his wife could bake. When they had finished their meal, the shoemaker told his wife to carry the pan back to its owner. She refused, however, and declared that she did not like to carry back borrowed articles. As he insisted, they nearly came to blows, but finally they agreed to go to work, and the one who spoke first should return the pan to its owner. The shoemaker seated himself on his platform, sewing and handling his shoes and his leather. His wife took her seat by her spinning wheel, and soon they were working as if life depended upon their handiness. Neither uttered a sound. In a short time a squire who lived in the neighborhood, and who had given a pair of shoes to the shoemaker to repair, passed the house, bid his coachman stop, and sent his servant in, asking him to see whether his shoes were finished. The servant walked in, greeted, and delivered his errand. ""Whew, whe-ew, whe-e-e-e-e-e-ew!"" whistled the shoemaker, who sat on his three-legged chair, battling with the air, and sewing diligently. As the servant could not draw a single word from him by way of answer, he turned to the woman, whose spinning wheel went so rapidly that sparks flew from it. ""How is it,"" asked he, ""that your husband does not answer when I talk to him?"" ""Tralalalide-lide-raderade-lidelidelidelidelide-ralala!"" sang the woman at the top of her voice, spinning with all her might and looking straight into his face. The servant saw that there was nothing for him to do but return to his master in the carriage. The two people must have lost their senses! When he reached the carriage, the squire asked him if the shoes were finished. ""I don't know,"" replied he. ""The shoemaker and his wife must have lost their senses. The man whistles and the woman sings, and those are all the sounds they utter. They would not say as much as one plain word. "" The squire alighted to see what had happened to the persons within. ""If they pretend to make fun of their customers, I shall teach them manners,"" said he to herself. ""Here they are, and here I come. "" So saying, he opened the door and walked in. The shoemaker whistled with all his might as soon as the squire opened his mouth to speak. The woman sang and shouted with all her might; but neither of them seemed to notice his question as to the shoes. At length he became vexed, seized his riding whip, and lifted it over the woman's shoulders. The shoemaker stole a glance at them, but said nothing. A minute later the whip was dancing lustily across the shoulder blades of the woman, who at once struck up a new tune, but less merry than before. But this was too much for the shoemaker. He jumped from his seat, rushed at the squire, and bid him stop. ""Ah,"" exclaimed the squire. ""You are not mute. I am pleased to know that your voice is in as good working order as your fingers seem to be.

She said that she wanted to stay in the bed, but he said that he would drive the chariot. She said that she did not want to ride. He said that he would climb into the hayloft and watch the horses. When the horses came to the straw, the man stepped into the wagon and drove them around the field. The girls asked him who he was, and he said that he was their shepherd friend from the woods. He drove them to the sea, and when he returned they told him that a sea nymph had cohabited with him, and that he had rescued their mother from being drowned. To honor him for this miracle, the people of the village built a statue of Jon the hunter above the church mouth, where he sat on his horse during the day, and had a golden horn with him always. When the peasant reached him, he asked him if he had seen a man carrying a bundle of clothes and a pair of boots.

The owner is sitting there with his head in the hay. "" The boy took a stick and struck the iron stall, and the iron gate opened. The boy walked through the opening door, and he did indeed find the shaven-headed devil sitting in the hay. The latter asked him where he had come from, and the boy told him.

Meanwhile the husband was busy collecting the discarded corn, and when he came to the pile, it was filled with golden flax. He took it home to his old wife, and she put it into an basket and went along with the other women. Then the man noticed that the basket was empty, and he asked his wife what had happened to it. She told him that the chick had crowed while still alive, and that the sound had been heard by the cuckoo bird, who in return had chased off the crowed crow. The man now told his wife that he had found his husband dead. She thought to herself, ""How can I be expected to know what my husband would think?"" and so she asked her husband the next day, and he again told her that he had found her dead. She thought to herself, ""How can I be expected to know what my husband would do?"" and so she asked her husband the third day, and he again told her that she should beat the child with a switch. The day after the child cried, the Fiend Crow flew up and carried it to the top of a tree. The Devil, looking down, saw the dead man, which made him smile. He then taught the boy how to kill the bird with a switch. The boy did this, and the dead man's hand emerged from the tree. The next day the boy went to the same tree and picked up a fruit basket. He then hid the basket next to the bird and discovered that it had been transformed into a basket of gold. He then pretended that he had collected the stolen basket. The deceived people watched as the bird brought them their evening meal, and then crowed together. The crowed cried out: Killcrop! Killcrop! So the children ran to their grandmother's house, and told her what they had seen. She took the child and raised it till it was time for her to return home. When she came back, her child was lying in the cradle with a leg on each side. She looked at it, and the leg had grown into a giant's hand. She chopped it off and kept it in the church. The people were very frightened by this, and started to run home as fast as their legs could carry them.

Shortly before Christmas, Peer set out again on another expedition.

They all wanted to try it on at once, so they put a foot each into it; but Peer made haste and tightened the rope, took one of the handspikes and fastened the rope round it, and got them at last securely tied up in the shoe.

The farmers were so busy that they could not wait for the dishes to cool, and so it was very little they had for their money).

In the year 1607 the devil caused a great heathen outcry by appearing on that waterway and by performing such miraculous acts there that the inhabitants feared the worse. Then a peasant from Läänäs named Andreas Prawitz jumped off a bridge over the lake and began swimming. As he kept swimming, his beard got longer and longer, until finally his beard was entirely covered with fire, which became a glowing fire and then began to grow wings. He flew up into the air and broke all the glass windows in the house, then he went into the house through the broken glass. The servants ran and took a long hot shower before they knew what was happening, as the fire had so beautiful an an beauty for their skin that they had to wash their hair and wash their bodies thoroughly before they could look at it. Then they waited for the devil to return so they could repeat the ablative (ritual washing).

He then commanded the kitchen to be washed, and he did indeed wash all of the dishes and make the entire house smell pleasingly when he came out. He then commanded the maids and the butler to bring him a virgin from among them, a maid who had never even kissed a man, a maid who had never even seen a man. The butler brought the virgin to the bed where she was to lie down and then he said: ""Now you must go to the tavern at once and tell them that my master requested the maiden to be taken away from the bed, and instead be carried by her finger to the street where she will be killed. "" That was exactly what happened. The butler had the key to the slave bedroom. When he went to the tavern afterwards, the maiden told him that the slave room was closed, but that there was a lock on the door, so she would have to take the key with her. Then the butler took the key and opened the slave bedroom door, so the maiden climbed into the bed with the man and pushed him into the room with the maid. She touched the lock to see if it was strong enough to open, but it wasn't. Therefore she had to go back to the slave room and tell the master that something had to be done about the lock or he would kill the maid. The master knew nothing about lock-making and hadn't wanted to kill the maid, so he ordered her to head back to the slave quarters and report to him.

When the moment came they all shook their glasses in his face and danced with him, pelting him with stones and cutting off his head. His head was then thrown to the beasts at the next public spectacle in the theater. And the fate that awaited him, that he might have been the town's plague, should have been repeated. Nothing was to be done but to abandon one's little child for them, and all the mothers were urged to do the same.

The countryman, discovering the trick of his companions, drew out the bread half baked, ate it by himself, and turned again to sleep. In a while, one of the tradesmen, as frightened by a marvelous dream, began to get up, and was asked by his companion, why he was so frightened. He answered, ""I am frightened and dreadfully surprised by a marvelous dream: it seemed to me that two angels, opening the gates of heaven, carried me before the throne of God with great joy.

Upon this she became particularly worried as to her husband's welfare and told one of her brothers where to find him in case of need. This brother, finding the situation alarming, went to the pond to help his friend remove the stolen corn (it occurred to him that the creature might have come upon the stolen corn and be unable to catch it). While he was away the wife and the others scurried about inside trying in every possible way to find the missing corn. At last they succeeded in removing all of it and finding only a few kernels lying loose on the bottom. Upon seeing this, the husband asked his wife how things had come to this. She told him that when her husband came home after work he always kept them fed with butter that he had stolen from the store. The man took this to mean that her husband was a Witch and that he was responsible for all of the husband's ills. The woman believed him and told her husband what the others had done. Following the advice of his wife, the man threw the butter on the fire to make it hot and melted the butter before putting it into the pots for cooking. However, he did not wash his hands afterwards, and they still bleed to this day. The next morning his wife woke him and said that he was always so well taken care of and always cheerful, but that he had been watching somebody looking at him in the bath and that in two hours he would be burned to ashes.

The king, perceiving that one of the boys had seen and heard all that took place, granted him permission to pass over with his own stream. He, in turn, asked his father whether he might use the same bridge in a dream, to which he replied in the negative. In the meantime, one of the sons of Agred (a town in the province of Dniester) dreamed in a trance that if he would cast a bridge over Cador's well, then Cador's well would become as wide as Potosi. He went and threw a bridge over it. All the horses that were within reach of the bridge instantly got in and were riding toward Potosi. They were so jolly that everyone spoke nicely to their companions. Then all the swans flew low over the head and flew away with the bridge. Only the king stayed mute. When they got to Potosi the king jumped off the bridge and was drowned in the river. The second dream was even more powerful. He saw that his dream was not forgotten. Neither the stick from earlier, nor the loaf from the table, nor even the glass from the wine go unopposed. So he threw all three to the swans. But he did not forget the first dream, where he saw the swans taking the three things away, and he did not let them return to whence they came. Instead, on their return they fell upon the children, devouring them all, except for John, who hid himself and was only just able to rise on his hind-legs when he saw his brothers in danger. Then he called his brothers by name and by his magic power caused the swans to carry them to the bottom of the well.

The Quaker laughed at his simplicity, and told him that he had had that night a very curious dream himself, which was, that if he went and dug under a certain bush in Upsall Castle in Yorkshire, he would find a pot of gold; but he did not know where Upsall was, and inquired of the countryman if he knew, who, seeing some advantage in secrecy, pleaded ignorance of the locality; and then, thinking his business in London was completed, returned immediately home, dug beneath the bush, and there he found a pot filled with gold, and on the cover an inscription in a language he did not understand.

The rumors apparently took their rise in the fact that one Muhammadan and three Hindu children have been missing in Madras and have not yet been traced, though the circumstances attending their disappearance did not suggest foul play. But once rumor had got about, false alarms began to be raised whenever a child slipped out of sight for a few minutes. Thus people's minds became excited and they fell into a panic. As a result, in the last two days several innocent people have been savagely assulted by excited crowds in different parts of the town, having come under suspicion for perfectly innocent actions. Thus, one man seen carrying his own child on a motorcycle was stopped and assulted. A person appears to have been beaten to death. The Commissioner of Police has taken all possible steps to restore confidence, and the Coproration has been invited to assist. It is hoped that all members of the public will help in allaying this foolish panic which has already had such tragic consequences. Investigations show no reason to suppose that any gang of kidnappers is at work in Madras.

They had kind words for each other, and took good care to say no evil words to it, lest they should lose their secret friends. Now there was soon to be a big fight at the town gate. The outsiders said they could arrange a place to throw their bags of gold into, if the fight would go on until the end of the race. When the fight was almost finished, St. George took the bag from the underground people and pushed it into the middle of the fight. The underground people dropped their bags, which were soon buried in the earth, and started for the sky. Now only the first bag was left. They turned their eyes to the sky, and saw a beautiful fairy spinning. And every so often she would look at the wrong side of the person doing the spinning, and she would say with a threatening voice, ""You're not big enough for me. "" That made them so angry that they rushed at the girl they knew was already on the other side of the wall, and they pushed her down into the pit. Now only the left bag was left. The fairy told the girls that if they wanted to get their gold back they had to do what she asked. They told her that they already had it, and that she just had to ask her brother for it. The fairy told them to go to a carriage that was standing there. That carriage had five horses and was completely filled with rich gentlemen. The girls saw that it was full of gold. They wanted to take it home for their own use, but the rich men threatened them with dire punishment if they did so. So they decided to wait until a day when they could do as they wished. In the meantime their rich father returned and found them in possession of his stolen treasure. Happy that he had rescued them from the clutches of the underground people, he became as joyous as ever. The same night he brought them home his wife. After a while he began to transform himself into a horse. He got onto one side a turf horse, put his arms out to one side, and began to trot slowly to the place where his wife was lying. He started off so slowly that at first he did not see the country. At last he came to a bridge of ice, and when he came to the middle of the bridge a tall man started off with him. ""I am hardly able to keep up with you. Where are you going?"" ""Oh, I am going to take you home with me, because as you can see, there is no longer any poverty in my house. I am making all the new things. You will like them. "" The old man put his arm around her, and said, ""For sure. Goodbye. "" As she said farewell to the old man, she put off her red cap and slipped away. She did not see anyone again until the cat came once every morning and Bitsy the mouse put her in touch with the rich man. Then she was transformed into a beautiful woman. She was so beautiful that all the men wanted to have her. Once a rich man summoned her to his house. He gave her a beautiful goat skin as a reward for what she had done for him. She told him that her name was Bitsy and that she would become the most beautiful woman in the world if she could fulfill three wishes. The rich man promised her that if she could accomplish these three wishes he would make her a slave to him. He told her to say no evil, and that he would make her happy. He also told her that if any harm came to her through negligence, he would punish her. She agreed to these things. With that the rich man turned into a lion and tore through the forest with her.

One Sunday, while the people were at church, and King Jon was hunting in its neighborhood, his dogs started and followed a hare, which, to conceal itself, ran into the church, and up before the altar. Both the dogs followed at its heels, and of course greatly disturbed divine service, as the priest was just in the middle of his sermon, but the confusion was made still worse, when King Jon came riding into the church to get hold of his prey, which the hounds had already secured. The priest grew angry at this, and said that he thought it highly unbecoming thus to disturb the service, but the King did not trouble himself for that. ""If I may only keep my hunting both here and after my death,"" said he, ""other folk may well keep both divine service and heaven for me. "" Having by this time got hold of the hare, he turned his horse in front of the altar and trotted out of the church. He died some time after this, but can find rest nowhere, and on clear summer evenings he rides in the air followed by his hounds. The sound of this can often be heard, and it is bad to meet him when one is alone. 2 When three doors with locks stand open in a line with each other, Jon the hunter and his dogs have power to enter, if they are in the neighborhood. In this way he entered a large farm on Hjorte-naes, and asked what they had to spare for Jon the hunter that day. The farmer went out and brought a big ferocious bull, every bit of which they ate up on the floor of the room, for they were thoroughly hungry. When this was done, the hunter told the farmer that in future he should have great luck with his cattle, and so it turned out: his cows often had two calves thereafter. 3 A woman in Svendstrup [Svenstrup?] was up one morning before daybreak to brew the Christmas ale, and had let the two doors of the brew-house stand open. These were right opposite each other, and by and by three hounds came running in and began to lap the ale out of a vessel. She guessed they were Un's hounds, and was afraid, but thought it best to make friends with them, so she went up and patted them, saying, ""Poor things.

The former married a slovenly woman, whose wasteful ways soon brought them into need, and with time their only hope was to borrow money from the good and thrifty pastor. But they quickly squandered this new-found wealth, and the married brother returned to the good parson requesting additional help. Questioned by the pastor as to the conditions in their household, the husband admitted that a priest, known by the name Sir John, was often a guest in their home. ""I suspect that this Sir John may be up to no good,"" warned the pastor, then outlined a plan to his gullible brother to reveal the true purpose of the priest's visits. Accordingly, the husband took the chamber pot from his own bedroom to the pastor, who spoke a charm over it; and the pot was then returned to its normal place beside the married couple's bed. Announcing that he would be away for some time, the husband took leave of his wife. No sooner had he disappeared from view than the wife sent for Sir John and began to prepare a feast for the two of them. Then having eaten their fill, they retired to the bedroom. In the middle of the night the priest arose to make water and picked up the chamber pot with his two hands, but to his alarm he discovered that some mysterious power held him fast to the basin. ""Woman, help me!"" he cried to his bed partner. She jumped to his aid, but immediately found herself stuck to him and to the pot as well. Their combined cries awakened the servant girl who ran, stark-naked, to help her mistress, but she too stuck to the pot. What followed was quite a dance: The three of them spilled onto the street just at daybreak, and one after another different villagers tried to pull them apart, only to become stuck to the procession themselves. Finally they were approached by the husband and his brother the parson.

It is said that the hell hounds were terribly afraid of the piper, and it is said that his clothes always covered him. It is said that his food was left for him everywhere, and that he never lacked for any thing. However, his love for the girl was unbounded, to the point that he often spent all his money on her. At last the man, who was becoming tired of his beautiful wife, gave her up to the spirits in return for a certain sum of gold. They found him, as he was climbing to his loftiest cave, wretched and covered with rats and mice. Miraculously it remained standing, and all his servants who came to see what was the matter, laughed louder than ever. However, the king recognized in the cat's situation, and said that he would make it up with her. He invited her to his palace, and gave her a beautiful sum of money in payment. She gladly accepted it, and all the time she was receiving it, she was aware of neither time nor place. Thus it went through several streets, then out through the convent gate, and then suddenly it was night again. Many days passed, and the king commanded her to make up the money she had saved in a jar. She said to him, ""But how can I do that?"" ""The way,"" replied the cat, ""is the easy way; follow me!"" The king followed her, and when he saw her lying on the ground, he called out, ""Well, your cat, why are you such a fool?"" The cat replied, ""The king is my king, and I am your slave; let me tell you how I stay the fast night. "" And while she was speaking the cat was jumping up and down on the ground, roaring loudly, and making no attempt to do anything. When the king became aware of the state of affairs, he came to believe that there was no escape from it; and he gave the cat a kick in the leg, which made her kick up a tree. The king ordered a bus to be brought to the palace, and the king's son went to the window to ask what he had to do for him. The cat said, ""Go along with you! As long as you are barking I shall remain sitting there and roar!"" So the hare ran on and on, and every time he barks he gives rise to the lion. But the hare, who was enjoying himself mightily, was soon tired of it, and he wished to be rid of it, but he knew of no place to which he could go to escape. Then he saw the wolf coming up of the forest and said, ""Let us think of a place where we may all be at liberty to live together without fear of hearing any curses uttered by our master. "" These words infused hope and courage into the poor cat's heart. She turned to the king and humbly asked leave to live in peace on his property, which he granted her, and they shared the cave for some time together. A day came, however, when the hare began to lose his patience, and he was irritated by the constant use of his name, and by the elated look on his master's face. One day he was watching some of the huntsmen, who were counting out the hare in front of the others, when he began to bolder speech, and he called out, ""Shall we race?"" Those who were hunting had heard a lot about hares, and understood that they were very numerous, and that there was no living creature could ever survive it. So it went on, and there were so many hares that when the sun went down all the hares left their families. The only living creature left behind was the jackal, which was so exceedingly small that he thought he would not be able to overtake the other hares. So he ran ahead of the rest and bounded into the open. After he had gone a long distance he began to consider in what way he should fare, and at last he decided to fetch up the hare which had run ahead of him, and which was half covered with hair, and which was the cause of all the hair of the hare. Then he thought he would pull the hair of the other animal, and so he did as the hare himself had advised him. When he reached the place where the other hare lived, he was so well received that one day he took a few of the hares out to play, and never again let them be seen.",0.5647595146257631,0.7647595146257631,-0.2,0.0

Five hundred robbers who had plundered a hill-town were led by an evil star to that spot, where they perceived the elephant. As it was just then a time of hunger with them, they said, ""Let us eat the meat and drink the water. "" The countryman replied, ""What is the use of taking food and sleeping if we do not seize the elephant by force?"" They answered, ""Then we will see. "" And they told him, ""We will lie down on the ground and draw lots to see which of us should run to water and swim. "" The countryman did as they did, and remained in the river lying down. The other five hundred men ran to the springs and swam. The lot fell to the youngest, and he ran to water and rose to the surface. He had not gone a few yards when the countryman returned from his run to the river, to whom he had told the other men what had happened. When he had told them, the chief made them promise to give him the first prize. The countryman now drew his sword and cut off the elephant's tail. When the others saw what he had done, they were very much alarmed, and said, ""Our forefathers have forbidden us to kill the old men, but we cannot deprive them of their strength. "" Then the countryman struck the youngest man wherever he saw him, and the others did the same. But when the young man returned and took the elephant's skin from the king, he took only a few of the red antlers, and refused to take the rest. The ants asked him why he did so, and he replied, ""If I had kept my promise I would not now be in such a great danger. "" The ants then came to believe that he had only a wooden statue in his hand, and that he did not really have the power to protect them, but that he made do with the rest, and that he had no sooner cut off the antlers than he found a fresh pile of ivory lying there on the ground. And when the king heard that, he was of a sure heart, and promised to make the lion whole again, but he never lived to see the lion's skin returned to him.",0.29966865329267045,0.7996686532926705,-0.5,0.0

He was about to make up for this ungrateful action, when suddenly a tall figure dressed in a deep flowing garment appeared before him.

At length he commanded the worker to turn himself into a human, and as soon as he had done so, the strange creature left the cave and became a man, limping like one and unable to hear or see much.

There he willed the lion to rage, until the poor man could do nothing but give himself up to his powers. Even the emperor was astonished at this, and forced Doctor Faustus to leave the castle of Lusignan. To be sure, the noble knight gave up the fortress of Lusignan, but rather than depart he stayed one night in the castle of Mersent. And then he returned to the castle of Mersent, and when he came to the well that was running goldily all alone, he called upon some of his servants and told them to say to him what he would buy there. When the men began to ring out their bells from the tips of their noses, the lion roared again, and plunged himself once again into the well.

Because everything was in such good order in the city, except for one poor old man, everyone shied away from her, and her relatives begged the king to deed his property to them. He did so, and when he later visited the place he observed that the inhabitants were sad because of his disappearance. He asked them why they were sad, and they told him that his departure had come as a great surprise to them, as they had count and lineage passed through him. To account for this, he asked the count and the countess whether they remembered that he had promised to give his sword to them, if they would help him. They both told him that they did, and he promised them his sword back if they would ever remember his name. They did so, and the count said to his wife, ""Now go and bring the stick back to me.

Many years ago, when the roads around here were very poor, a woman went to Goslar every week to bring back earthenware to sell. She left here early in the morning, often not returning until after nightfall. One time she stayed in Goslar longer than usual, not leaving until it was already half dark. But she knew every step of the way, so she lifted her pack basket filled with earthenware to her back, and proceeded merrily on her way toward Clausthal.

Suddenly she saw a large fire and noticed some people. Thinking they must be charcoal burners or woodcutters, and being very thirsty, she approached them to ask for some water to drink. But as she came closer, she saw to her great fear that it was a giant huntsman and his companions seated around the fire--a terrifying sight. They were roasting a huge stag on a spit above the fire. But worst of all, some horribly large dogs were running about, and they suddenly chased up to her, jumping at her until she could feel their hot breath, and snapping at her coat as though they wanted to tear her apart. The men just sat there, paying no heed to the terrified woman. Everything was so uncanny, so quiet. She ran as fast as she could to escape from the beasts' claws. She ran, driven by terror, until she at last collapsed and lay there unconscious beneath her pack basket. When she finally awoke she saw a man standing over her. He was wearing a green miner's hat and a black jacket, and was carrying a large torch in his hand. He helped her up and asked her what she needed. She tearfully told him what had happened and that because of her running and her fall her earthenware had probably broken to pieces. She was very poor, and all that she owned was invested in this trade, and today everything was in this trade, and today no one knew anything about her. Now everything was in pieces, and she did not know what she would do. The juryman, for this is who the woman thought was standing before her, felt sorry for her. He pulled her coat away from her pack basket and looked inside with his torch. He told her that everything was in order. Then wishing her good luck [He uses the expression ""Glückauf,"" a traditional miner's greeting. ], he set off in the direction of Goslar.

But she could not resist looking into the pack basket to see what had happened to her earthenware, to see if anything could be salvaged. Looking inside, she was startled to see, instead of broken pieces, or pots and jars, nothing but shiny coins. She immediately ran to her landlady, a clever old woman.

He was in love with a girl named Gudrún, who dwelt in a farm on the opposite side of the valley, separated from his house by a river. The deacon had a horse with a gray mane, which he was always in the habit of riding, and which he called Faxi. A short time before Christmas, the deacon rode to the farm at which his betrothed lived and invited her to join in the Christmas festivities at Myrká, promising to fetch her on Christmas Eve. Some time before he had started out on this ride there had been heavy snow and frost, but this very day there came so rapid a thaw that the river over which the deacon had safely ridden, trusting to the firmness of the ice, became impassable during the short time he spent with his betrothed. The floods rose, and huge masses of drift ice were whirled down the stream. When the deacon had left the farm, he rode on to the river, and being deep in thought did not perceive at first the change that had taken place. As soon, however, as he saw in what state the stream was, he rode up the banks until he came to a bridge of ice, on to which he spurred his horse. But when he arrived at the middle of the bridge, it broke beneath him, and he was drowned in the flood. Next morning, a neighboring farmer saw the deacon's horse grazing in a field, but could discover nothing of its owner, whom he had seen the day before cross the river, but not return. He at once suspected what had occurred, and going down to the river, found the corpse of the deacon, which had drifted to the bank, with all the flesh torn off the back of his head, and the bare white skull visible.

The following day their number was added to by the coming of a young, courageous and newly married man from Kinnar, in Lummelund. When they related to him their adventure of the night before, he made fun of their being afraid to take a beautiful woman by the hand, and boasted that if he had been present he would not have neglected to grasp the proffered hand. That evening when they laid themselves down in the same room, the late arrival with them, the door opened again, and a plump, white woman's arm, with a most beautiful hand, reached in over the sleepers. The young man arose from his bed, approached the door and seized the outstretched hand, impelled, perhaps, more by the fear of his comrades scoffing at his boasted bravery, than by any desire for a closer acquaintance with the strange visitor. Immediately his comrades witnessed him drawn noiselessly out through the door, which closed softly after him. They thought he would return soon, but when morning approached and he did not appear, they set out in search of him. Far and near the search was pursued, but without success. His disappearance was complete. Three years passed and nothing had been heard of the missing man. His young wife, who had mourned him all this time as dead, was finally persuaded to marry another. On the evening of the wedding day, while the mirth was at its highest, a stranger entered the cottage. Upon closer observation some of the guests thought they recognized the bride's former husband. The utmost surprise and commotion followed. In answer to the inquiries as to where he came from and where he had been, he related that it was a sea nymph whose hand he had taken that night when he left the fisherman's hut; and that he was dragged by her down into the sea. In her pearly halls he forgot his wife, parents, and all that was loved by him until the morning of that day, when the sea nymph exclaimed, ""There will be a dusting out in Kinnar this evening. "" Then his senses immediately returned, and, with anxiety, he asked, ""Then it is my wife who is to be the bride?"" The sea nymph replied in the affirmative. At his urgent request, she allowed him to come up to see his wife as a bride, stipulating that when he arrived at the house he should not enter. When he came and saw her adorned with garland and crown he could, nevertheless, not resist the desire to enter. Then came a tempest and took away half the roof of the house, whereupon the man fell sick and three days later died.",0.6708622994357081,0.770862299435708,-0.1,0.0

""But as you enter the gate,"" said the old man, ""you must divide the bread which I have given you among the monkeys which are guarding the gate to the palace; otherwise you will not be able to enter. "" Don Juan took the bread; and when he reached the palace, he did as the old man had advised him. After entering the gate, he saw a big monkey. Frightened at the sight of the animal, Don Juan was about to run away, when the animal called to him, and said, ""Don Juan, I know that your purpose in coming here was to find your fortune; and at this very moment my daughter Chonguita will marry you.

Now he had a wife who once scolded a beggar woman for having so many children while not knowing how to feed them. The beggar woman cursed her, and the next time she gave birth, she gave birth to nine boys at one time. Count Bruno had just set forth on a trip to the heathens, but when he came to a meadow just outside the town gate, his donkey stood still and refused to proceed. Try as he might, he could not get the donkey to move. Then he perceived that this was a sign from God that he should not undertake the trip, and he turned around. In the meantime, the countess, fearing that her husband would think ill of her when he learned that she had given birth to nine children at one time, ordered the midwife to put eight of them into a kettle and to drown them. The latter was carrying the kettle toward the spring near the castle -- which to this day is called Bruno's Spring -- when she was met by Count Bruno, who was just returning to the castle. Hearing one of the baby boys crying , he asked her what she had in the kettle. She could not keep it a secret, and told him everything that had happened. He commanded her to keep secret what he was going to do, and told her to tell his wife that she had drowned the children. He took the children to different people who lived in the same street -- the street is still called Bruno Street -- and had them raised there. One day after they had grown, he had the eight boys dress up exactly like the ninth one. He then asked the countess what a mother would deserve who drowned her own children, saying that such a case had come before him, and he did not know the right punishment. She said that such a woman should be forced to stand in red hot shoes. Scarcely had she said this when her nine children -- which the count had kept hidden until now -- stepped before her. He asked her to identify her own child from among them. She could not do this, and he subjected her to the judgment that she herself had spoken. To commemorate the fact that a donkey had prevented him from continuing on his journey, he had a chapel built in meadow where this happened, and the meadow is still called Donkey Meadow. Every year during the Easter week a fair was held and a great dispensation was granted there. The fair still takes place every year, and in the castle they still have the kettle and the iron shoes in which the countess suffered her punishment.",0.5857653423975113,0.7857653423975113,-0.2,0.0

samples-46500,"The Lion and the Saint If you should have the opportunity of seeing any large picture gallery abroad, or our own National Gallery in London, you will be very likely to come across some picture by one or other ""old master"" representing an old man, with a long beard, sometimes reading or writing in a study, sometimes kneeling in a bare desert-place; but wherever he may be, or whatever he may be doing, there is almost always a lion with him. The old man with the beard is St. Jerome, who lived fifteen hundred years ago, and I want now to tell you why a lion generally appears in any picture of him. At one time of his life, St. Jerome lived in a monastery he had founded at Bethlehem. One day he and some of his monks were sitting to enjoy the cool of the evening at the gate of the monastery when a big lion suddenly appeared walking up to them. The monks were horribly frightened, and scampered off as fast as they could to take refuge indoors; but St. Jerome had noticed that as the lion walked he limped as though in pain, and the Saint, who always tried to help those in trouble, waited to see what he could do for the poor animal. The lion came near, and when he was quite close he held up one paw and looked plaintively at the men. St. Jerome fearlessly took the paw on his lap, and, on examining it, found a large thorn, which he pulled out, binding up the injured limb. The wound was rather a bad one, but St. Jerome kept the lion with him and nursed him carefully till he was quite well again. The lion was so grateful, and became so much attached to his kind doctor, that he would not leave him, but stayed on in the monastery. Now, in this house no one, from the highest to the lowest, man or beast, was allowed to lead an idle life. It was not easy to find employment for a lion; but at length a daily task was found for him. This was to guard and watch over the ass, who each day carried in the firewood which was cut and gathered in the forest. The lion and ass became great friends, and no doubt the ass felt much comfort in having such a powerful protector. But it happened, on one very hot summer's day, that whilst the ass was at pasture the lion fell asleep. Some merchants were passing that way and seeing the ass grazing quietly, and apparently alone, they stole her and carried her off with them. In due time the lion awoke; but when he looked for the ass she was not to be seen. In vain he roamed about, seeking everywhere; he could not find her; and when evening came he had to return to the monastery alone, and with his head and tail drooping to show how ashamed he felt. As he could not speak to explain matters, St. Jerome feared that he had not been able to resist the temptation to eat raw flesh once more, and that he had devoured the poor ass. He therefore ordered that the lion should perform the daily task of his missing companion, and carry the firewood instead of her. The lion meekly submitted, and allowed the load of faggots to be tied on his back, and carried them safely home. As soon as he was unloaded he would run about for some time, still hoping to find the ass. One day, as he was hunting about in this fashion, he saw a caravan coming along with a string of camels. The camels, as was usual in some places, were led by an ass, and to the lion's joy he recognised his lost friend. He instantly fell on the caravan, and, without hurting any of the camels, succeeded in frightening them all so completely that he had no difficulty in driving them into the monastery where St. Jerome met them. The merchants, much alarmed, confessed their theft, and St. Jerome forgave them, and was very kind to them; but the ass, of course, returned to her former owners. And the lion was much petted and praised for his goodness and cleverness, and lived with St. Jerome till the end of his life.",0.7713559728810413,0.7713559728810413,0.0,0.0

For many days they feasted with great melody; and the king remained awake long into the night praying to God, for man cannot live while there is war in Jerusalem. He wanted to conduct these festivities in as magnificent a manner as he had the elephants perform during his wedding festivities. He invited certain chief persons in the town to receive him, who had come to see him off. Among these was a certain woman who had been sentenced to be hung as a witch, although she had never shown any overt sign of being so. She was to be put to death with the people's clothes, etc. in the town's church. The people were to assemble during the night in huge confabulations [semblages] to watch the hanging. It was to be a magnificent event. At the appointed hour the woman would leave her house and go down to the street where she expected to see her executed. It was very dusk when she arrived at the place to where her body was to be burned. It was said that some boys were walking slow distances to and from school that day, so they waited for her in the most shameful manner possible. They saw her sitting there with her little child at her breast. They shouted to her that they knew what she was looking for, and that she ought to carry it with her. She would not do this. Therefore they broke her horse's neck with a stone, drowned its child in a pond, or whatever it was that she was carrying. When the day of the execution came, the people broke out into noisy applause. The king, when he saw them cheering, asked the girl what she was doing there.

A person who was himself dead was first sought out in the woods, and after having been dead for one or three days nurses were sent to him, saying that he was again in danger of being killed. They brought him to the witch of Treva, who struck off the victim's head with a hatchet, after which they themselves took hold of him and carried him into the woods.

The former married a slovenly woman, whose wasteful ways soon brought them into need, and with time their only hope was to borrow money from the good and thrifty pastor. But they quickly squandered this new-found wealth, and the married brother returned to the good parson requesting additional help. Questioned by the pastor as to the conditions in their household, the husband admitted that a priest, known by the name Sir John, was often a guest in their home. ""I suspect that this Sir John may be up to no good,"" warned the pastor, then outlined a plan to his gullible brother to reveal the true purpose of the priest's visits. Accordingly, the husband took the chamber pot from his own bedroom to the pastor, who spoke a charm over it; and the pot was then returned to its normal place beside the married couple's bed. Announcing that he would be away for some time, the husband took leave of his wife. No sooner had he disappeared from view than the wife sent for Sir John and began to prepare a feast for the two of them. Then having eaten their fill, they retired to the bedroom. In the middle of the floor stood a table without any set of tablescloth, and forming a large circle around it, put the two wives into the form of a married couple. The clergyman, observing this, concluded that they were still alive, and caused the two men to join hands and confess their guilt. The honest gardener, discovering the trick, called out: ""What! You preach to me ! You don't know your measure!"" And how the truth came to light was that one of the wives, having fallen in love with a handsome officer, dreamed that she should go to the siege of Lewes; and when the morning came she similar dreamed that she should go to the town of Mobberley, where she would be able to marry the prince. In this state she went on her way until she arrived at a town in the land of the Scots, where the people seemed to be very sad. She went to the minister for advice, who told her that she must go into the country and find herself a husband. After she had walked a long distance, she stopped to look around and saw a very beautiful girl lying on a grassy knoll. She then asked the girl if she had seen a handsome officer, and the girl replied that she had, and that he was very ill. The king, informed of this, commanded the servant to put the girl into his bed. The girl was crying and moaning, and she seemed to be suffering from some disease. The shepherd hence decided to change some of his sheep into ducks or robins, and he brought them to the place where the fairy woman had been seen. He then laid his eggs, and they grew up and became full-grown. When they were old enough, one day the fairy woman came along and asked the shepherd how he should manage them. The farmer told her that she must prepare a large soup, and when she had made it he would ask her what she had in it. She said that she had no soup. He then asked her what she had in it.

Both the dogs followed at its heels, and of course greatly disturbed divine service, as the priest was just in the middle of his sermon, but the confusion was made still worse, when King Jon himself came by, with his hunting gear, and dogs at his heels. The priest grew angry at this, and said that he thought it highly unbecoming thus to disturb the service, but the King did not trouble himself for that. ""If I may only keep my hunting both here and after my death,"" said he, ""other folk may well keep both divine service and heaven for me.

They said they could not do it, and asked him if he could get them some corn, and then he would have no more trouble with the fellers. When he returned the borrowed corn he gave it to the fellers, and when they asked him to watch the prize, he said he would not, but would accept it when they had it. When they asked him to give it up he refused, and they took it back. Some time after they asked him to give it up, and he said he had no more use for it. When they brought it back he gave it to the miller, who said he would use it when he got it. One day when he went to the river to bathe he found a pebble in the river that he took into the river and turned upside down so that it would not sully. The miller said he would use it immediately if the goblins would just leave him alone. They told him that if he said ""shaved"" that meant the end of the world, and ""bought"" that meant the beginning of the world. When he heard this, it did not please him, and he began to beat his chest. At last he said ""sheep"" and beat his chest with his hands. Just then the miller went to the river to bathe, and when he came to the river it ran ahead of him, and he swam after it. The miller began to laugh, and said ""I can see no more than a shank on you, you rascal!"" But the fox said nothing, only covered his ears with his hands.

About a year after, the countess, who had at first resisted all his advances, let down the siege door and fled to her convent, taking with her the one daughter who remained with her at home. After the count had departed, the nunnery was emptied and the abbess, who had not been able to resist the first offer of love, allowed herself to be wooed by a young monk. This monk became very intimate with her and promised to safeguard her with his life. He did this, and although the abbess did not desire to have this done, she was forced to accept it. Later he would come to the place where she lived and proclaim his intent. He would then bring his warrior and kill her. She could then neither escape nor be saved. In order that the abbess might confess on his knees the real state of affairs, he told her the following story: Near the year 1262 there lived in the village of Anhalt two brothers, who were both millers. One of them was good and orderly, the other bad and ill tempered. When they were working in the same mill they did not wait for one another and made each other work even harder. This annoyed the good brother, and in an angry manner he slew the ill-tempered brother. In response to the deed, which was witnessed by both their wives, the two brothers begged that the other should do them the justice to the death. The other workman, seeing that the dead brother did not exist, agreed to this, and to bring the net to the grave as soon as possible. The other workman, after working five days without a single loss of life, accompanied the other workman to the river bank where they were to make the net. But when they were just upstream of the river bank the other workman suddenly collapsed with a severe disease. The first workman, instead of accompanying him, lagged behind and drowned. This mortified the poor fellow so much that he swore that he would do anything the other workman asked of him, even if it meant that he had to eat the mouse that the other workman had preserved for his own dinner. Some time later the other workman, with the help of a servant, brought the mouse to his master and preserved it in an earthenware bowl in his room. One day the first workman was summoned to the master and asked to come to the castle. He readily complied with the request and went with the servant to the count's residence. During the night when the other workman was sleeping, the servant walked back and forth in the room and suddenly fell ill. He was asked what was wrong with him and where he had been. He replied that he had been unable to resist the temptation of the mouse and that although he had resisted the temptation to eat it, he had failed to do so. He was then placed in a room and ordered to eat no food until he could be cured. Later that day when the countess heard the sad story she curtly told the count to go away and not to try to comfort him with talk. The sad count felt badly incensed when he heard the old servant talk about his sorry lot, and he adding that he was sorry too, went away through the garden and down the street without trying to woo the aged woman as he had promised.",0.7189512617988728,0.8189512617988728,-0.1,0.0

As a learned professor and with the permission of the academic senate he lectured in the large auditorium of the Collegium Building about Greek poets. Indeed, he explained Homer to his audience, the students, describing the heroic figures of the Iliad and the Odyssey so realistically that the students expressed their desire to see them with their own eyes. He made this possible, conjuring them up from the underworld, but when the students saw the powerful giant Polyphemus, they all became terrified and wanted to see or hear nothing more from him. He drove through the narrowest street in Erfurt with a double-span load of hay, for which reason this street has ever since been called ""Dr. Faust's Street. "" Once he came riding a horse that ate and ate and could never be satisfied. Another time he tapped all kinds of wine from a wooden table and made the drunken drinking companions think that they saw grapes. They wanted to cut them from the vines, but when he caused the deceptive image to disappear, each one had another one's nose in his fingers instead of wine grapes. A house in Schössergasse is said to still have an opening in the roof that can never be closed with roofing tiles because Faust used it for his cloak rides. He is said to have created a magnificent winter garden and provided delicious meals for numerous noble guests, thus achieving a high reputation. Soon everyone in Erfurt was talking of nothing but Dr. Faust, and it was feared that a great many people would be led astray through his devilish arts. Thus a learned monk by the name of Dr. Klinge was sent to convert him. But Faust did not want to be converted. In response to the masses and prayers directed at tearing him away from the devil, Dr. Faust said, ""No, my good Dr. Klinge, it would be disreputable for me to break the contract that I signed with my blood.

He seemed to live in the forest, for he always went out during the day and stayed out all night. His parents could not be coaxed to come before the authorities, and they lived in fear of being hanged as 'adulteresses. ' Once a chief magistrate was traveling through the forest, and he was so outraged by the constant stink of the old woman's waste that he ordered all the officers of the forest to come and fetch her. They came, and having fetched her,denied her asylum, and put her where no one could see her. What was the chief magistrate's punishment for allowing a fornicating woman to escape with such impudence? He was made a prisoner in the old woman's house. The girl was let out by the wall, and all the orders that were given were to keep him there until the next midnight, Saturday, the day on which he was to be hanged. The order was immediately executed. What was the woman's crime? She had given birth to a healthy and vigorous child at the age of ninety. The gibbet was set up, and the old woman, who had not been able to become as old as the rest of the girls, was forced to stay in the cell with the dog that she had brought with her.

Then a boy came who was quite special. He was unlike any boy that the authorities had ever seen. He had blue eyes and a hair above the elbow that was like a tail. He did everything that the woman asked of him, and did it better than any boy her age could. And this is how the boy became like his kind.

And lo, Ann-Els recovered soon thereafter, and when her health had fully returned, the knight made himself ready to depart on a pilgrimage. With many tears he took leave of his wife and journeyed to the sea, where together with companions he had met underway he boarded a ship. At sea the ship was attacked by pirates. He and his companions were taken prisoner and sold as slaves to an eminent Turk. Year upon year passed, and his wife received no news from him. Because she was wealthy, she received many marriage proposals from neighboring knights, but she was interested in none of them and rejected them all, which caused a great deal of hate and animosity toward her. Then one day she heard from another pilgrim who was returning home from the promised land that her husband was languishing as a prisoner among the Turks, and she resolved to rescue him, cost it what it may. Dressing herself in men's clothes, she took her harp, which she could play very well, and journeyed across the sea to Turkey. Arriving there safely, she sought and inquired after her husband until finally she discovered where he was. Then one day she approached the Turk who was his master and played such beautiful melodies on her harp, and sang with such charm, that the Turk said she should name her own reward, that he would give her anything she requested. Then she said, ""I ask only for a slave to serve me,"" and from among the slaves she selected one -- her dear husband. However, she did not identify herself to him, but kept him away from her. After the sea voyage was successfully completed and they found themselves again on Christian soil, she left a sum of money for him, then secretly slipped away and hurried home as fast as possible. Not long afterward Conrad too arrived at Tannenberg Castle and was joyfully and festively received by his wife. All the knights from the surrounding area came to the castle to wish him well. While they were eating Knight Conrad told them of his adventures, how he had been captured, mistreated, and so miraculously rescued. Then several of the knights whose marriage proposals Ann-Els had rejected whispered into his ear that in the meantime his wife had been traveling about the land dressed in men's clothes and leading an indecent life. Upon hearing this Conrad jumped up angrily, drew his sword, and attempted to kill Ann-Els, but she fled into her room and barred the door so that he could not harm her. Not long afterward she returned to the hall carrying her harp and wearing the clothes in which she had freed Conrad, and she played a melody. Then Knight Conrad jumped up and fell into the singer's arms. She threw off the clothes and stood there as the faithful Ann-Els.

As the Jew and the Christian had already eaten their evening meal when the sweetmeats arrived, they proposed to lay them aside till the morrow; but the Muslim, who was going to leave the house before the cock crowed, and who had not brought a word with him, proposed to sleep himself. To this the other two refused to consent, alleging that the Muslim wanted to eat the whole of the sweetmeats himself. Then the Muslim proposed to divide them into three portions, so that each might eat his own portion when he pleased; but this also was objected to by the others, who quoted the proverb, ""The divider is in hell. "" The Muslim explained to them that this proverb meant the man who divides his allegiance between God and lust; but they still refused to give way, and the Muslim therefore submitted, and lay down to sleep in the endurance of the pangs of hunger. Next morning, when they awoke, it was agreed between them that each should relate his dreams, and that the sweetmeats should be awarded to him whose dream was the best. The Jew said that he had dreamed that Moses had carried him to the top of Mount Sinai, and shown him marvelous visions of the glory of heaven and the angels. The Christian said he had dreamed that Jesus had carried him up to the fourth heaven and shown him all the glories of the heavens. Finally the Muslim said that the Prophet Muhammad had appeared to him in person, and after commending him for his piety in saying his prayers and keeping fast so strictly on the previous night, had commanded him to eat up those divinely provided sweetmeats as a reward, and he had accordingly done so. The Jew and the Christian were at first annoyed with him for thus stealing a march upon them; but on his pointing out that he had no option but to obey the Prophet's commands, they admitted that he had done right, and that his dream was the best, as he had been awake, while they were asleep.

The water-man usually wears a red cap on his head, and the water-woman red stockings on her feet. Further, in the towns of Upper Lusatia it has been observed that if a man wearing a linen jacket with a wet bottom hem comes to the weekly market and buys grain at above the market price, then grain will become more expensive. However, if he sells grain at a better price than others, the price of grain will fall. This man is the water-man. His wife is often seen sitting on a bank in her red stockings spinning or bleaching her laundry. In this last instance it means there will be rainy weather or high water.

These she gave to journeyman so he could take them to her husband in paradise. And then the journeyman disappeared with the clothes. When her husband came home, the woman told him that a little while ago a journeyman had been here, and that she had given him boots and clothes for her blessed deceased husband, for the journeyman had come directly from paradise. The man cursed about her stupidity, and asked in which direction the journeyman had left, for he intended to pursue him and take the clothes away from him. In order to make better time, he chased after him on horseback. The journeyman had gone a good way down the main road when he saw a rider in the distance. Seeing that it was a peasant, he immediately assumed that he was being pursued. Therefore he quickly threw the boots and the clothing over a garden fence, then sat down next to the road and placed his hat next to him in the grass.

One of our group told the following story: A woman from our region constantly contradicted her husband, always disputing everything that he said, and at all times insisting on having the last word. One day she had a vicious argument with her husband, finally calling him a lousy rascal. Attempting to force her to take back her words he struck her with a stick, his feet, and his fists. But the longer he beat her, the more she called him a lousy rascal. When he finally grew tired of beating her, in order to break her of her stubbornness, he tied a strap around her and carried her to the well, then threatened to drown her if she did not cease insulting him. But the woman continued with her insults, repeating the word lousy, even as the water reached her chin. With that her husband let her sink entirely underwater so that she could no longer say anything and to see if the threat of death might cure her of her stubbornness. However, nearly drowned and unable to speak, she expressed herself with her fingers. Lifting her hands above her head she pressed her two thumbnails together, and with this gesture showed her husband's lousiness, for it is with these thumbnails that women normally kill lice.",0.6779640340346466,0.7779640340346465,-0.1,0.0

Approximately a century ago one such oxen dug out a treasure from the mine near Scharfenbrück. However, the oxen died while digging the hole, and their contents were lost. After they died, the withered remains of the oxen went into a pile and lay forgotten about, even after the War of the Sixth Ages had come to an end. But finally a soldier wanted to take credit for saving the day, and he reported that he had discovered the thieves' trick. The king recognized the soldier's desire to escape with great pleasure, and he granted him permission to go to Rome with his wife. When the soldier went to Rome he took with him the stone which had been removed from the oxen. He walked about the whole of the summer, without anything occurring, and then he returned to his wife in the fall. Soon afterward he had a very pleasant dream. He thought that if he drew a circle around himself and then threw it into the well, it would disappear as soon as the water dried up. So the soldier did what he had dreamed. He went to a field where a herd of oxen was grazing. When he threw the stone into the well it traveled outward, and suddenly it came back to him. He stood still, and looked at it. It had the mark of a black ox allers hot from the deal. He then bought a colt, and the same thing occurred again. He sold the foal to a jeweler and had it changed from one form to another.

They were skilful in embroidery; and she used every day on her way home from work to gather some flowers for them to use as patterns. One day when she found no flowers along her route homeward she went into the woods to look for wild blossoms, and she unwittingly invaded the domain of a fairy serpent, that coiled around her, held her tightly, and railed at her for having entered his garden. The woman excused herself, saying that she came merely to get a few flowers for her daughters, who would be sorely disappointed were she to go home without her usual gift to them. The snake asked her the number, the names, and the ages of her daughters, and then refused to let her go unless she promised one of them in marriage to him. The poor woman tried every argument she could think of to induce the snake to release her upon easier terms, but the reptile would accept no other ransom. At last the father, dreading greater evil to his daughters should they be deprived of his protection, gave the required promise and went home.

Some days passed; his daughters carefully prepared his meals, and affectionately besought him to eat them, but he would not come to the table. He was always plunged in sorrowful meditation. They conferred among themselves as to the cause of his uncommon behavior, and, having decided that one of them must have displeased him, they agreed to try to find out which one it might be, by going separately, each in turn, to urge him to eat. The eldest went, expressed her distress at his loss of appetite, and urged him to partake of food. He replied that he would do so if she would for his sake marry the snake to whom he had promised a wife. She bluntly refused to carry out her father's contract, and left him in deeper trouble than before. The second daughter then went to beg him to take food, received the same reply, and likewise declined meeting the engagement he had made. The youngest daughter then went and entreated him to eat, heard his story, and at once declared that, if he would care for his own health properly, she would become the bride of the serpent. The father therefore took his meals again, the days sped without bringing calamity, and the welfare of the family for a time seemed secure. But one morning, as the girls were sitting at their embroidery, a wasp flew into the room and sang: ""Buzz! I buzz and come the faster; Who will wed the snake, my master?

The next morning two wasps came, singing the same refrain; the third morning three wasps came; and the number of wasps increased day by day, until the girls could no longer put them to rout, nor endure their stings. Then the youngest said that, in order to relieve the family of the buzzing plague, she would go to her uncanny bridegroom.

"" He was born in the year 1500, and followed the employment of fishing for one hundred and forty years. When about eleven or twelve years old, he was sent to Northallerton with a horse-load of arrows for the army of the Earl of Surrey, on its march to the north, all the men being then employed at harvest. When he was more than one hundred years old, he used to swim and wade across the river with the greatest ease, and without catching cold. What is the most remarkable, he retained his sight to the last, having made without spectacles two artificial flies for fishing the year before he died; his hearing also continued till his death. Being summoned to give evidence in a tithe cause in 1667, between Charles Anthony, Vicar of Catterick, and Calvert Smithson, owner and occupier of lands in Kipling, he deposed, ""That the tithes of wool, lamb, &c. , mentioned in the interrogatories, were the vicar's, and had been paid to his knowledge six score years and more. "" And in another cause at York, between John Grubham Howe, Esq. , and Mrs. Wastell of Eilerton, about the royalty of the river Swale, he gave evidence to one hundred and forty years.

Finally the executioner had to come and chop off the hand. They put it in a box and kept it in the church. 2. A child's hand, wrapped in a silk cloth, is kept behind the alter in the church at Petschow, between Tessin and Rostock. The people there tell how a wayward child had lifted his hand against his parents. The child died soon afterward and was buried. The hand that had been lifted against the parents grew out of the grave. They placed it back beneath the earth several times, but it always reappeared, until they finally chopped it off. 3. In the church at Garwitz, a village in the vicinity of Parchim, behind the altarpiece there is a hand that was chopped off just beneath the joint. The following legend is told about it: A girl abused her parents, and even struck her mother so hard that the mother died of the consequences. Soon after the mother's death, the girl herself died. She had lain in the grave for only a few days when her wicked hand emerged. The villagers beat it with whips and a few times it withdrew back beneath the earth. Finally, because it ceased retreating from the whips' blows, they chopped it off. It is preserved even to this day.

Filled with terror, the girl rushed up the walls of the apartment the door was opening into; but when she had gone only a few yards, she found herself inside a room, in which there was a fire and an angry company of soldiers, who were chasing the cat. Shaken, the girl got up and barred the door shut behind her. She then tried to extinguish the fire, but failed to do this as well. Seeing the foolishness of her son, she said to herself, ""Now, at last, I can no longer herd goats, for they have given me a red jacket. "" She went to the chest and tried to carry it off with her, but failed to do so. Seeing she had been unsuccessful, she picked it up and threw it away, believing that it would be found next time she went to market. This time it came to market, and she bought it. When she was returning home, she saw a little man two feet high standing by the door, calling out, ""My wife is coming too. "" She went home and took leave of him with tears in her eyes. In the morning she found a hollow tree had sprung up in the field, and in the afternoon she went to market with the full expectation of finding a fortune. No one asked her who she was or where she had been. When she came to the gate of opportunity she looked straight into the bear's eyes and said, ""I know who you are. "" ""Oh, you know me,"" said the beast, ""but I have never seen you before. "" ""Where?"" asked Don Pedro. ""Behind the fireplace,"" replied Don Juan. When Don Pedro and Don Diego saw the monkey, they were very much surprised. ""Oh!"" exclaimed Don Pedro. ""What happened to you? Did you lose your head?"" Don Juan could say nothing to this question. At last, however, he broke out, ""Let us go home! Our father must be waiting for us. "" So saying, Don Juan turned around and began the journey. Don Pedro and Don Diego, together with their wives, followed Don Juan. Chonguita walked by her husband's side. When the return of the three brothers was announced to the king, the monarch hastened to meet them on the stairs. Upon learning that one of his sons had married a monkey, the king fainted; but after he had recovered his senses, he said to himself, ""This misfortune is God's will. I must therefore bear it with patience. "" The king then assigned a house to each couple to live in. But the more the king thought of it, the greater appeared to be the disgrace that his youngest son had brought on the family. So one day he called his three sons together, and said to them, ""Tell your wives that I want each one of them to make me an embroidered coat. The one who fails to do this within three days will be put to death. "" Now, the king issued this order in the hope that Chonguita would be put to death, because he thought that she would not be able to make the coat; but his hope was disappointed. On the third day his daughters-in-law presented to him the coats that they had made, and the one embroidered by Chonguita was the prettiest of all. Still anxious to get rid of the monkey wife, the king next ordered his daughters-in-law to embroider a cap for him in two days, under penalty of death in case of failure. The caps were all done on time. At last, thinking of no other way by which he could accomplish his end, the king summoned his three daughters-in-law, and said, ""The husband of the one who shall be able to draw the prettiest picture on the walls of my chamber within three days shall succeed me on the throne. "" At the end of the three days the pictures were finished. When the king went to inspect them, he found that Chonguita's was by far the prettiest, and so Don Juan was crowned king. A great feast was held in the palace in honor of the new king. In the midst of the festivities Don Juan became very angry with his wife for insisting that he dance with her, and he hurled her against the wall.

The compound ""nightmårt"" is also very common. The forms ""mår"" (masculine) and ""måre"" (feminine) also exist. The designation ""alp"" is recognized as well. All of these names are used to designate the spirit being that sits upon a sleeping person's chest, thus depriving him of motion and speech. The approaching being sounds like the gnawing of a mouse or the quiet creeping of a cat. The mårt can be captured by grasping it with an inherited glove or by closing up all of the room's openings as soon as the sleeping person begins to groan. Mårt-pressure (also called a mårt-ride) can be prevented by crossing one's arms and legs before falling asleep. In the Oldenburg district, in Saterland, and in East Friesland, the alp is called ""wåridèrske"" or ""wäridèrske. "" In the vicinity of Wendisch-Buchholz the same being is called the ""Murraue.

During a rain storm, one must be careful to not stand beneath such a twig, because if rain drops fall on a person from such a nest, the murraue will surely sit on him during the night. A person whose eyebrows grow together is called a murraue. A murraue can be either a man or a woman, who has spent all his or her time in putting the dead skin into the river or into the woods. A murraue can also be a boy or a girl who has spent all his or her time in putting the dead skin into the river or into the woods. A murraue can be either a large or a small crab.

This disfigurement caused him a good deal of annoyance, and he had spent a considerable sum of money in trying to get rid of it. He took various medicines and applied many lotions, but instead of the wen disappearing or even diminishing, it increased in size. One night, while the old man was returning home laden with firewood, he was overtaken by a terrible thunderstorm, and was forced to seek shelter in a hollow tree. When the storm had abated, and just as he was about to proceed on his journey, he was surprised to hear a sound of merriment close at hand. On peeping out from his place of retreat, he was amazed to see a number of demons dancing and singing and drinking. Their dancing was so strange that the old man, forgetting caution, began to laugh, and eventually left the tree in order that he might see the performance better. As he stood watching, he saw that a demon was dancing by himself, and, moreover, that the chief of the company was none too pleased with his very clumsy antics. At length the leader of the demons said: ""Enough! Is there no one who can dance better than this fellow?"" When the old man heard these words, it seemed that his youth returned to him again, and having now forgotten his childish delight in the chase, he zealously pursued the chase. After a while, however, the hounds came nearer and nearer, and at last the fox was compelled to give in. Then the fox said that he could not live without the deer on which he had been so faithful, and hereupon the shepherd set out to reclaim him.

After a few months, however, the younger of the two began to grow pale and lean, lose his appetite, and show other marks of declining health. His brother, much concerned, often questioned him as to what ailed him, but to no purpose. At last, however, the poor lad burst into an agony of tears, and confessed that he was quite worn out, and should soon be brought to the grave through the ill-usage of his mistress, who was in truth a witch, though none suspected it.

Then, seated on my back, she urges me on for many a mile to the wild moors, where she and I know not what other vile creatures hold their hideous feasts. There she keeps me all night, and at early morning I carry her home. She takes off my bridle, and there I am, but so weary I can ill stand. And thus I pass my nights while you are soundly sleeping. "" The elder brother at once declared he would take his chance of a night among the witches, so he put the younger one in his own place next to the wall, and lay awake himself till the usual time of the witch-woman's arrival. She came, bridle in hand, and flinging it over the elder brother's head, up sprang a fine hunting horse. The lady leaped on his back, and started for the trysting-place, which on this occasion, as it chanced, was the cellar of a neighboring laird. While she and the rest of the vile crew were regaling themselves with claret and sack, the hunter, who was left in a spare stall of the stable, rubbed and rubbed his head against the wall till he loosened the bridle, and finally got it off, on which he recovered his human form. Holding the bridle firmly in his hand, he concealed himself at the back of the stall till his mistress came within reach, when in an instant he flung the magic bridle over her head, and, behold, a fine gray mare! He mounted her and dashed off, riding through hedge and ditch, till, looking down, he perceived she had lost a shoe from one of her forefeet. He took her to the first smithy that was open, had the shoe replaced, and a new one put on the other forefoot, and then rode her up and down a plowed field till she was nearly worn out. At last he took her home, and pulled the bridle off just in time for her to creep into bed before her husband awoke, and got up for his day's work. The honest blacksmith arose, little thinking what had been going on all night; but his wife complained of being very ill, almost dying, and begged him to send for a doctor.

The mother, of course, blessed it, and the Strathspey lads took no further notice, and soon after set out with their goods. They had not gone far when they found a fine healthy child lying all alone on the road-side, which they soon recognized as that of their friend. They saw at once how the thing was. The fairies had taken away the real child and left a stock, but, owing to the pious ejaculation of the mother, they had been forced to drop it. As the urgency of their business did not permit them to return, they took the child with them, and kept it till the next time they had occasion to visit Glenlivat. On their arrival they said nothing about the child, which they kept concealed. In the course of conversation, the mother took occasion to remark that the disease which had attacked the child the last time they were there had never left it, and she had not little hopes of its recovery. As if to confirm her statement, it continued uttering most piteous cries. To end the matter at once, the lads produced the real child healthy and hearty, and told how they had found it. An exchange was at once effected, and they forthwith proceeded to dispose of their new charge. For this purpose they got an old creel to put him in and some straw to light under it. Seeing the serious turn matters were likely to take, he forthwith revealed the secret to his brother, who at once declared him mad, and sent him to the insane asylum. The authorities were dubious of the existence of the strange complaint, and of the necessity of seeing a doctor.

The folk made but one journey, and when they arrived at the house they discovered the true purpose of the demon's visit. The doctor was sent for to view the house, and, although he was told that the patient had been mad before, he refused to put him to death. The elves, however, and their fairy advisers, seemed to have had power over the Maker of the world, and he restored the child. Not far from the well there is a rock, called the Fairy Rock, of which the following story is told. Many years ago, when the folk were often in the neighborhood, a number of them used to come to Glenlivat to steal butter.

Just then he heard a lion near him moaning and groaning and at times roaring terribly. Tired as he was Androcles rose up and rushed away, as he thought, from the lion; but as he made his way through the bushes he stumbled over the root of a tree and fell down lamed, and when he tried to get up there he saw the lion coming towards him, limping on three feet and holding his forepaw in front of him. Poor Androcles was in despair; he had not strength to rise and run away, and there was the lion coming upon him. But when the great beast came up to him instead of attacking him it kept on moaning and groaning and looking at Androcles, who saw that the lion was holding out his right paw, which was covered with blood and much swollen. Looking more closely at it Androcles saw a great big thorn pressed into the paw, which was the cause of all the lion's trouble. Plucking up courage he seized hold of the thorn and drew it out of the lion's paw, who roared with pain when the thorn came out, but soon after found such relief from it that he fawned upon Androcles and showed, in every way that he knew, to whom he owed the relief. Instead of eating him up he brought him a young deer that he had slain, and Androcles managed to make a meal from it. For some time the lion continued to bring the game he had killed to Androcles, who became quite fond of the huge beast. But one day a number of soldiers came marching through the forest and found Androcles, and as he could not explain what he was doing they took him prisoner and brought him back to the town from which he had fled. Here his master soon found him and brought him before the authorities, and he was condemned to death because he had fled from his master. Now it used to be the custom to throw murderers and other criminals to the lions in a huge circus, so that while the criminals were punished the public could enjoy the spectacle of a combat between them and the wild beasts. So Androcles was condemned to be thrown to the lions, and on the appointed day he was led forth into the Arena and left there alone with only a spear to protect him from the lion. The Emperor was in the royal box that day and gave the signal for the lion to come out and attack Androcles. But when it came out of its cage and got near Androcles, what do you think it did? Instead of jumping upon him it fawned upon him and stroked him with its paw and made no attempt to do him any harm. It was of course the lion which Androcles had met in the forest. The Emperor, surprised at seeing such a strange behavior in so cruel a beast, summoned Androcles to him and asked him how it happened that this particular lion had lost all its cruelty of disposition. So Androcles told the Emperor all that had happened to him and how the lion was showing its gratitude for his having relieved it of the thorn. Thereupon the Emperor pardoned Androcles and ordered his master to set him free, while the lion was taken back into the forest and let loose to enjoy liberty once more.",0.7054560587440916,0.8054560587440915,-0.1,0.0

A minute later Peter had to enter the room to see what was going on. Hermann was again sitting there, but this time he was much more quiet than before.

""I'm afraid I cannot tell you,"" said Peter, ""as I am not a son of your enemy, and as your bet gives me no rights. "" ""Then tell me,"" said Hermann, ""what is it you want!""

""I'm going to live at Gustloff House,"" replied Hermann. ""You went away like that on the moor, and I'm going to follow you until I find you. "" Peter had to admit that the child was right. He did not want to live beneath the ground any longer. He went home, and his mother took him in the cellar where she still kept the missing cheese. When she saw there was something wrong with the child, she thought it was a bomb, fire, or some other dangerous thing, and set it on the hearth instead of taking it to the doctor. The underground people came and took the child and brought the stolen cheese. Hermann grew up and became a wealthy man. However, he was always the last one to show himself, and often forgot to appear. In 1667 things came to a head at the Prack-Stille, when King Paddy himself came to see a friend who still lived. The intoxicated soldier was about to kill the king when he was suddenly knocked down and nearly killed by someone else. Everyone was terrified, and nobody knew who it was that had done it. It was Hermann, of course. He had already done the deed and was hiding in the house. A peasant from the village saw him and made a long walk with his knife, hoping to find it. He found it and had the devil brought to the bone, where he held the king until a doctor could be had. The king was saved. Hermann never again dared to strike his friend. From that time forth he always appeared before people with a sick person, and they could not get rid of him. Finally he came to the hearth of the priest, who finally said to him, ""You must go to the devil, and you must say who you think sent you. "" Hermann answered, ""I'll see you there. "" With that he left, and soon followed by all the other devils. They could not find him for a long time, and no one knew what to do about him. Finally he said, ""The devil sent me, and I am the only one who can save you, for if you go away, he will break out into the fields and reap much damage. "" As soon as these words were out of his mouth, the devil was there, and he quickly said, ""I will come to you immediately, for you are my brother. "" Hermann said, ""Yer never going anywhere for a while. "" ""Me neither,"" replied the devil. ""I have some things to do. "" Hermann went on, ""If you come now, you must make peace with me, for I have great greed. "" As soon as this was said, the devil was there, and he quickly said, ""There is no one here today,"" for he was hidden and could not see anyone. ""Then there will be someone tomorrow,"" said the devil. ""Today there is none,"" said Hermann. ""Then I must go.

There the pupils learned witchcraft and all sorts of ancient arts. Wherever this school was, it was somewhere below ground, and was held in a strong room which, as it had no window, was eternally dark and changeless. There was no teacher either, but everything was learnt from books with fiery letters, which could be read quite easily in the dark. Never were the pupils allowed to go out into the open air or see the daylight during the whole time they stayed there, which was from five to seven years. By then they had gained a thorough and perfect knowledge of the sciences to be learnt. A shaggy gray hand came through the wall every day with the pupils' meals, and when they had finished eating and drinking took back the horns and platters. But one of the rules of the school was, that the owner should keep for himself that one of the students who should leave the school the last every year. And, considering that it was pretty well known among the pupils that the devil himself was the master, you may fancy what a scramble there was at each year's end, everybody doing his best to avoid being last to leave the school. It happened once that three Icelanders went to this school, by the name of Sæmundur the Learned, Kálfur Arnason, and Hálfdán Eldjárnsson; and as they all arrived at the same time, they were all supposed to leave at the same time. Sæmundur declared himself willing to be the last of them, at which the others were much lightened in mind. So he threw over himself a large mantle, leaving the sleeves loose and the fastenings free. A staircase led from the school to the upper world, and when Sæmundur was about to mount this the devil grasped at him and said, ""You are mine!"" But Sæmundur slipped out of this mantle and made off with all speed, leaving the devil the empty cloak. However, just as he left the school the heavy iron door was slammed suddenly to, and wounded Sæmundur on the heels. Then he said, ""That was pretty close upon my heels,"" which words have since passed into a proverb. The Sæmundur contrived to escape from the Black School, with his companions, scot-free. Some people relate, that, when Sæmundur came into the doorway, the sun shone upon him and threw his shadow onto the opposite wall. And as the devil stretched out his hand to grapple with him, Sæmundur said, ""I am not the last. Do you not see who follows me?"" So the devil seized the shadow, mistaking it for a man, and Sæmundur escaped with a blow on his heels from the iron door. But from that hour he was always shadowless, for whatever the devil took, he never gave back again.",0.6434730433340908,0.6434730433340908,0.0,0.0

A man who has contributed nothing to his children's existence for a long time will in this life be looked down on with contempt, and often, if ever, his resentment will be roused against him. Thus it has been with the present family. Our grandfather, a poor village official, was born with an extremely delicate structure, and until a very young age was nourished entirely on corn flour. He was the son of an old woman who was a weak and troublesome woman. After giving birth to him, she was very poor, and until very late in his life was entirely dependent on her husband for her living. He was a living memory to her. He was highly sensitive to anything that might make him appear to be less deserving of her charity and support than she, his child. He was unable to resist the temptation to complain to his parents, especially when they appeared to be treating him coldly and even angrily. He always dreaded being compelled to make good on an unwaivable slight, and would rather die than offend them again. One evening, when he was nearly dead with fear and grief, he found, on going down to the river to pick up some earth he had left in its banks, that his poor grandmother, who had been lying ill with a malady which made her almost insupportable, had only a little bandage upon her elbow, and an old woman to support her. He wept for some time in this perplexity, and then, being unable to bring himself to die, he decided to go to the old woman in order: to make her whole family believe that he had come to see her, and to gain her sympathy, and so relieve her distress. When he arrived there, he was greeted by her mother and sisters, who, on recognizing him, cried out: ""Gain'st thou no relief, grandchild? We can now easily make believe that thou did dar'st hear us, for thou did dar to the Doctor. "" He was then admitted to see the old woman, who was able to relate all that had happened. She was able, also, to give him some medicines which would restore his health, and his strength to a great stretch. She also administered to expectant mothers couriers for their young children, and these have all been thriving and well taken care of. The old woman declared that she had but one request, which (she said) the Doctor would certainly be unable to fulfil; so an order was passed concerning a sum of money, which was paid over to her. She returned, full of joy, saying: ""Now, children, thou shalt say to thine own self, if there be any good in this world, which thou didst hear me say, good, or ill, which I did see: if there be, make thy will upon me, and obey my word. "" Immediately after, the Doctor, who was in the first house on the right, went out to the field, and was suddenly enabled to shoot up flames of fire without ceasing, as if he had been clothed with power by some magician. He immediately withdrew, and the old woman, returning, was herself overwhelmed with good and pleasant-smelling grass, and began to think that all was well. But when she went to her great treasure, which was in her bed, it was found to be but partly in the coffin, partly outside. She was a-standing there on the point of dying, and she was permitted to go in after the funeral, when the coffin was conveyed to the grave. The old woman was taken to the house of one of the neighbors, and allowed to take her funeral counsel with one of those who had been brought together to advise her. The widow made a wager with her neighbor as to the number of her child's teeth she should keep. The neighbor, trusting to her familiarity with the Doctor's business, agreed to give her but five.

It was called the Sphinx. It had the body of a lion, and the upper part of a woman. It lay crouched on the top of a rock, and arrested all travellers who came that way, proposing to them a riddle, with the condition that those who could solve it should pass safe, but those who failed should be killed. Not one had yet succeeded in solving it, and the city was full of frightful stories. Pusseries were full of horrors, and the common people lived in fear of the monster. One day a woman on her way home from church was crossing the bridge on her way home. Suddenly she saw the features of her husband shining through the crowd, and she recognized him well enough, being familiar with his tricks. She threw herself headlong from the top of the bridge and struck off both ends of the lindorm's tail, thus saving her life. The Sphinx was so enraged at this that she plunged into the water, and the man, not having time to return to his own home, perished in the flood. For a long time no one had seen the Sphinx, and no one had heard of the Sable Man. However, someone sent to a doctor in the north near Ramsey ""doing charms"" to increase his wealth, and he said he could not find out anything new. When asked what he had in the water, he said he had a stone that had the form of a woman's waistband, and when he put it on she became a horse, and then ran off to the last farm of the neighboring countryman. The same was true with the other stone, and thus the good farmer by fraud had become a suspect in the robbery. He was forthwith summoned to the judge's court, and told him what to do. The judge spoke to the peasant, and said, ""Leave your foolish horse in peace, and I will address you in such a manner that you will become a wise man. "" The judge forthwith ordered the peasant to be brought before him, and asked him if he had ever seen a horse before. ""I have,"" answered the peasant, ""seen plenty of them, and they all look the same. "" ""Then be it so,"" answered the judge. ""I invite you here to tell me what you have in the water, or I will cause you to drown. "" Having thus summoned him,",0.5520123959913783,0.7520123959913783,-0.2,0.0

When there was much water, river and lake were one; but when the water was low, they were apart. Now fish and tortoises know by instinct when the year will be rainy and when there will be a drought. So at the time of our story the fish and tortoises which lived in that lake knew there would be a drought; and when the two were one water, they swam out of the lake into the river. But there was one tortoise that would not go into the river, because, said he, ""here I was born, and here I have grown up, and here is my parents' home. Leave it I cannot!"" Then in the hot season the water all dried up. He dug a hole and buried himself, just in the place where the Bodhisatta was used to come for clay. There the Bodhisatta came to get some clay. With a big spade he dug down, until he cracked the tortoise's shell, turning him out on the ground as though he were a large piece of clay. In his agony the creature thought, ""Here I am, dying, all because I was too fond of my home to leave it!"" And in the words of these following verses, he made his moan: Here was I born, and here I lived; my refuge was the clay; And now the clay has played me false in a most grievous way; Thee, thee I call, oh Bhaggava; hear what I have to say! Go where thou canst find happiness, where'er the place may be; Forest or village, there the wise both home and birthplace see; Go where there's life; nor stay at home for death to master thee. So he went on and on, talking to the Bodhisatta, until he died. The Bodhisatta picked him up, and collecting all the villagers addressed them thus: ""Look at this tortoise. When the other fish and tortoises went into the great river, he was too fond of home to go with them, and buried himself in the place where I get my clay. Then as I was digging for clay, I broke his shell with my big spade, and turned him out on the ground in the belief that he was a large lump of clay. Then he called to mind what he had done, lamented his fate in two verses of poetry, and expired. So you see he came to his end because he was too fond of his home.

He commences to build a palace for himself on the place where the ship lies buried, and he gives the name of Juan to the soil from which the ships are obtained.

It is said that an old barn stands on the right-hand side of the highway. One Sunday morning, as the master was starting to church, he told one of the servants to keep the crows from a field that had been sown with wheat, in which field the old barn stood. The servant, through some means, collected all the crows into the barn, and shut the door on them. He then followed his master to the church, who, when he saw the servant there, began to reprove him sharply. But the master, when he heard the strange news, turned his steps homewards, and found to his amazement that the tale was true, and it is said that the barn was filled with crows. This barn ever afterwards was called Crow-Barn , a name it still retains. It is said that the servant's name was Dafydd Hiraddug, and that he had sold himself to the devil, and that consequently, he was able to perform feats, which in this age are considered incredible. However, it is said that Dafydd was on this occasion more subtle than the old serpent, even according to the agreement which was between them. The contract was, that the devil was to have complete possession of Dafydd if his corpse were taken over the side of the bed, or through a door, or if buried in a churchyard, or inside a church. Dafydd had commanded, that on his death, the liver and lights were to be taken out of his body and thrown on the dunghill, and notice was to be taken whether a raven or a dove got possession of them; if a raven, then his body was to be taken away by the foot, and not by the side of the bed, and through the wall, and not through the door, and he was to be buried, not in the churchyard nor in the church but under the church walls. And the devil, when he saw that by these arrangements he had been duped cried, saying: Dafydd Hiraddug, badly bred, False when living, and false when dead.",0.6424623192214474,0.7424623192214473,-0.1,0.0

As they rode by him laughing and jesting, he could not tell whether they were aware of his presence or not. He looked intent at each countenance as it approached, but it was some time before he caught sight of the dear face and figure borne along on a milk-white steed. She recognized him well enough, and her features now broke into a smile -- now expressed deep anxiety. She was unable for the throng to guide the animal close to the ring of power; so he suddenly rushed out of his bounds, seized her in his arms, and lifted her off. Cries of rage and fury arose on every side; they were hemmed in, and weapons were directed at his head and breast to terrify him. He seemed to be inspired with superhuman courage and force, and wielding the powerful knife he soon cleared a space round him, all seeming dismayed by the sight of the weapon. He lost no time, but drew his wife within the ring, within which none of the myriads round dared to enter. Shouts of derision and defiance continued to fill the air for some time, but the expedition could not be delayed. As the end of the procession filed past the gate and the circle within which the mortal pair held each other determinedly clasped, darkness and silence fell on the old rath and the fields round it, and the rescued bride and her lover breathed freely.

The old man with the beard is St. Jerome, who lived fifteen hundred years ago, and I want now to tell you why a lion generally appears in any picture of him. At one time of his life, St. Jerome lived in a monastery he had founded at Bethlehem. One day he and some of his monks were sitting to enjoy the cool of the evening at the gate of the monastery when a big lion suddenly appeared walking up to them. The monks were horribly frightened, and scampered off as fast as they could to take refuge indoors; but St. Jerome had noticed that as the lion walked he limped as though in pain, and the Saint, who always tried to help those in trouble, waited to see what he could do for the poor animal. The lion came near, and when he was quite close he held up one paw and looked plaintively at the men. St. Jerome fearlessly took the paw on his lap, and, on examining it, found a large thorn, which he pulled out, binding up the injured limb. The wound was rather a bad one, but St. Jerome kept the lion with him and nursed him carefully till he was quite well again. The lion was so grateful, and became so much attached to his kind doctor, that he would not leave him, but stayed on in the monastery. Now, in this house no one, from the highest to the lowest, man or beast, was allowed to lead an idle life. It was not easy to find employment for a lion; but at length a daily task was found for him. This was to guard and watch over the ass, who each day carried in the firewood which was cut and gathered in the forest.

This grieved him in his latter years, his heart being good and pious; so to make the evil good again, he wrote a book, wherein he first shows how evil is to be done, and then how it may be remedied. The book begins by explaining what sorcery is, and with a warning against it. It is divided into three heads, viz. Cyprianus, Dr. Faustus, and Jacob Ramel. The last two parts are written in characters which are said to be Persian or Arabic, and also in ordinary characters. In this book are taught exorcising, laying and raising of spirits, and all that of which mention is made in the 5th book of Moses (XVIII: 10-12). Whether this book has been printed is uncertain, but manuscript copies of it are concealed here and there among the common people, who regard it as something sacred. Those who possess the book of Cyprianus need never want money; they can read the devil to them and from them, and no one can harm them, not even the devil himself. But whoever possesses the book cannot get rid of it; for whether he sells, burns or buries it, it will come back; and if a person cannot dispose of it before his death, it will go badly with him. The only method is, to write his name in it in his own blood, and lay it in a secret place in the church, together with four shillings clerk's fee. The following is the German tradition of Cyprianus: In ancient times there lived in one of the Danish isles a man named Cyprianus, who was worse than the devil; consequently, after he was dead and gone to hell, he was again cast forth by the devil and replaced on his isle. There he wrote nine books, in the old Danish tongue, on witchcraft and magical spells. Whosoever has read all these nine books through becomes the property of the devil. From the original work three (or nine) copies are said to have been made by a monk, and mutilated copies of these to have been dispersed all over the world. A count, who resided in the castle of Plön, is said to have possessed a perfect copy, which he caused to be fastened with chains and buried under the castle; because in reading through eight books he was so troubled and terrified that he resolved on concealing it from the sight of the world. One of these books still exists in Flensburg. Some spells from the nine books are still known among aged people. Whoever wishes to be initiated therein must first renounce his Christianity. Two miles from Horsens there dwelt a miller, who was a master in the black art and possessed the book of Cyprianus. A peasant having once stolen an axe from him, was obliged to bring it back at midnight, and was, moreover, borne so high in the air that his feet rattled among the tops of the trees in Bierre forest. This miller in fact performed so many wonderful things that all his neighbors were astonished at his feats. Impelled by curiosity, a journeyman miller once slipped into his master's private room, where having found an old quaint-looking volume, he began to read in it, when the horrible Satan appeared before him and asked his commands. The man, who was not aware that it was necessary to give the fiend some stiff job to execute, fell down in terror deprived of speech, and it would, no doubt, have been all over with him, had not his master entered at the moment and seen how matters stood.

The traveler begged to stay all night, but had to go away so early in the morning that if a mouthful of food were set ready for breakfast there was no need the family should be disturbed by her departure. The people of the house, however, arranged that a servant maid should sit up till the stranger was out of the premises, and then went to bed themselves. The girl lay down for a nap on the longsettle by the fire, but before she shut her eyes she took a good look at the traveler, who was sitting on the opposite side of the hearth, and espied a pair of man's trousers peeping out from under the gown. All inclination for sleep was now gone; however, with great self-command, she feigned it, closed her eyes, and even began to snore. On this the traveler got up, pulled out of his pocket a dead man's hand, fitted a candle to it, lighted the candle, and passed hand and candle several times before the servant girl's face, saying as he did so: ""Let all those who are asleep be asleep, and let those who are awake be awake.

She then shut the door, locked it, and ran upstairs to try and wake the family, but without success: calling, shouting, and shaking were alike in vain.

So he said to the carabao, ""Let us live together and hunt our food together! thus we shall break the monotony of our solitary lives. "" But the carabao snorted when he heard this proposal; and he replied, ""You slow thing! You ought to live with the drones, not with a swift and powerful person like me.

At first the carabao refused to accept the challenge, for he thought it would be a disgrace for him to run against a turtle.

Little wonder, therefore, is it that legends and traditions abound concerning them. These are often extremely local, and therefore little known. The names alone, however, suggest much. The memory of the mythical gods, satyrs, and nymphs of the ancient heathen times lingers in a few, as in Thors-kil or Thors-well, in the parish of Burnsall; and in the almost universal declaration -- by which not over-wise parents seek to deter children from playing in dangerous proximity to a well -- that at the bottom, under the water, dwells a mysterious being, usually named Jenny Green-teeth or Peg-o'-the-Well, who will certainly drag into the water any child who approaches too near to it. The tokens of medieval reverence for wells are abundant. The names of the saints to whom the wells were dedicated yet cling to them.

The friend sympathized very much with him, and promised to think over the matter, and call in a little while and tell him what to do. He did so; in a few days he visited the old man and put down four bags full of stones and gravel before him. ""Look here, friend,"" said he. ""Your sons will get to know of my coming here today, and will inquire about it. You must pretend that I came to discharge a long-standing debt with you, and that you are several thousands of rupees richer than you thought you were. Keep these bags in your own hands, and on no account let your sons get to them as long as you are alive. You will soon find them change their conduct towards you. Salám.

But the king, who was a cuckold, was not long deceived, and answered, ""You do not know what I can do for you if you are willing to do what I tell you. "" ""Tell me quick,"" said George. ""I am willing to do anything you want me for. "" ""Then hurry and wait for me,"" said the count. ""We do not have long to wait. The count has gone off to bed and fallen asleep, take a knife and cut off a few of the hairs that grow on his Adam's apple. If you do not do so, the devil will take you away from me. "" ""Oh, that is awkward,"" said the poor fellow. ""I am going to die anyway. "" ""Wait!"" said the count. ""I am going to bed as well. "" ""Then hurry and come with me. "" ""No, I cannot go with you. You are a burden to me. "" ""Then be quiet,"" said the count. ""We do not want to make a fool of each other. "" ""Oh, yes, sir,"" said the poor fellow. ""If you have a hundred wives, and you can eat no supper, how will you stay the death of your wife?"" ""I cannot eat dead flesh. "" ""Then fetch a jug of fresh water from the store behind the faggots and you will drink it. "" ""But how can I fetch it?"" ""Get on my back. "" The idiot obeyed, and at last they had all drunk enough, and the townsman was ready to go to bed himself. ""Why?"" asked the townsman. ""Because I don't know how to get rid of my wife. "" ""Why, I know!"" exclaimed the woman. ""My husband is dead! What will you do?"" The husband took leave of his wife and followed the lantern-man's advice. When he reached the place where the corpse was, he placed the cudgel upon the fire and took a good look at it. The bottom of the cudgel was full of earth, and as soon as it was out of the fire, the living creature drew out all the hair from its head, which had grown upon the body. So the bald man kept his wife as long as she lived.",0,0.7648116019037035,-3.0,0.0

He took his apprenticeship in bad weather, when all the other men were dandyish, and made a good shot at the blue-coats. When the boys came running in the morning with their buckets of water, it always broke his heart to see them, for he had glass eyes and all the others were as fine as gold. So he never saw them all summer. Just before the harvest the little fellows were good enough to go home for the holidays, and the big man had to go his way. He went to his land, where he had a fine fat cow. As he passed near his cottage, he saw one of his little shot friends running amuck in the snow. He grew much alarmed, for he knew that if he didn't drive it away it would have fathered a great large child on him. And he took counsel with the Lord, and determined to fly through the air in order to save the life of his shoot friend. He had already gone a good while when he heard a strange wailing sound.

On the heaths witches and little trolls ride, one on a wolf, another on a broom or a shovel, to their assemblies, where they dance under their stones. These stones are then raised on pillars, under which the trolls dance and drink. In the mount are then to be heard mirth and music, dancing and drinking. On Christmas morn, during the time between cock-crowing and daybreak, it is highly dangerous to be abroad. One Christmas night in the year 1490, as Fru Cissela Ulftand was sitting in her mansion at Liungby in Scania, a great noise was heard proceeding from the trolls assembled at the Magle stone, when one of the lady's boldest servants rode out to see what was going on. He found the stone raised, and the trolls in a noisy whirl dancing under it. A beautiful female stepped forth, and presented to the guest a drinking horn and a pipe, requesting him to drink the troll-king's health and to blow in the pipe. He took the horn and pipe, but at the same instant clapped spurs to his horse, and galloped straight, over rough and smooth, to the mansion. The trolls followed him in a body with a wild cry of threats and prayers, but the man kept the start, and delivered both horn and pipe into the hands of his mistress. The trolls promised prosperity and riches to Fru Cissela's race, if she would restore their pipe and horn; but she persisted in keeping them, and they are still preserved at Liungby, as memorials of the wonderful event. The horn is said to be of an unknown mixture of metals with brass ornaments, and the pipe of a horse's leg-bone. The man who stole them from the trolls died three days after, and the horse on the second day. Liungby mansion has been twice burnt, and the Ulftand family never prospered afterwards. This tradition teaches that Christians should act justly even towards trolls. It is also related of some priests, who were riding before daybreak by a mount on a Christmas morning, while the trolls were at their sports, how a berg- or mount-woman came out and offered them drink in metal bowls; and how they cast the drink behind them, but that some drops chanced to fall on the horses' loins and burned the hair off. The bowls they carried away with them, and such are still to be found in several churches, where, it is said, they were formerly used as chalices. This drink, which some trolls were in the habit of offering so liberally, was believed to have the property that it hindered the fairies in their attempts to steal unbaptized children and to take their place in church. For this reason, it was generally drunk by pregnant women. One night, while the mothers were in bed, the grandmother took seriously ill, and the relatives rushed her to the church. She lay for some time in the church, where some strange people were already in the room. The old woman went on to the church, and while she was lying there, she heard a little man, who came towards her, and she looked at him in order to see if he was a troll.

This was to guard and watch over the ass, who each day carried in the firewood which was cut and gathered in the forest. The lion and ass became great friends, and no doubt the ass felt much comfort in having such a powerful protector. But it happened, on one very hot summer's day, that whilst the ass was at pasture the lion fell asleep. Some merchants were passing that way and seeing the ass grazing quietly, and apparently alone, they stole her and carried her off with them. In due time the lion awoke; but when he looked for the ass she was not to be seen. In vain he roamed about, seeking everywhere; he could not find her; and when evening came he had to return to the monastery alone, and with his head and tail drooping to show how ashamed he felt. As he could not speak to explain matters, St. Jerome feared that he had not been able to resist the temptation to eat raw flesh once more, and that he had devoured the poor ass. He therefore ordered that the lion should perform the daily task of his missing companion, and carry the firewood instead of her. The lion meekly submitted, and allowed the load of faggots to be tied on his back, and carried them safely home. As soon as he was unloaded he would run about for some time, still hoping to find the ass. One day, as he was hunting about in this fashion, he saw a caravan coming along with a string of camels. The camels, as was usual in some places, were led by an ass, and to the lion's joy he recognised his lost friend. He instantly fell on the caravan, and, without hurting any of the camels, succeeded in frightening them all so completely that he had no difficulty in tearing them apart. He then lay down to rest on his own property. The merchants, much alarmed, hastened away and had the ass flayed. The lion came easily to the spot, and part of the cloth torn off the body and hung it on the gate. The other part of the cloth, which was the part that was left over, was wrapped in a stone and buried in the churchyard. About halfway between the gate and the churchyard the ass got up and entered the water. The lion partook of the food that was there and then lay down to rest. And then the ass got up and entered the water. Now the lion was tempted by the flavor of the meat and by the yield of the water, and he decided to try the ""limestone broth,"" which he had never tried before. Well, he took hold of the sheep and took them to the river, and then he rushed in as fast as he could against the current. The current threw him into the river, and as he remained beneath the water, he began to drink from the river every drop that fell onto him.

One day when he found no flowers along his route homeward he went into the woods to look for wild blossoms, and he unwittingly invaded the domain of a fairy serpent, that coiled around him, held him tightly, and railed at him for having entered his garden. The man excused himself, saying that he came merely to get a few flowers for his daughters, who would be sorely disappointed were he to go home without his usual gift to them. The snake asked him the number, the names, and the ages of his daughters, and then refused to let him go unless he promised one of them in marriage to him. The poor man tried every argument he could think of to induce the snake to release him upon easier terms, but the reptile would accept no other ransom. At last the father, dreading greater evil to his daughters should they be deprived of his protection, gave the required promise and went home. He could eat no supper, however, for he knew the power of fairies to afflict those who offend them, and he was full of anxiety concerning the misfortunes that must overwhelm his whole family should the compact be disregarded. Some days passed; his daughters carefully prepared his meals, and affectionately besought him to eat them, but he would not come to the table. He was always plunged in sorrowful meditation. They conferred among themselves as to the cause of his uncommon behavior, and, having decided that one of them must have displeased him, they agreed to try to find out which one it might be, by going separately, each in turn, to urge him to eat.

Some days after, the husband was again invited to the house of a friend where he was to pass the night; and, before departing, he enjoined the parrot with the same injunctions as before; wherefore his heart was free from care, for he had his spy at home. The wife and her confidante then planned how they might destroy the credit of the parrot with the master. For this purpose they resolved to counterfeit a storm; and this they did by placing over the parrot's head a hand-mill (which the lover worked by pouring water upon a piece of hide), by waving a fan and by suddenly uncovering a candle hid under a dish. Thus did they raise such a tempest of rain and lightning, that the parrot was drenched and half-drowned in a deluge. Now rolled the thunder, then flashed the lightning; that from the noise of the hand-mill, this from the reflection of the candle; when thought the parrot to herself, ""In very sooth the flood hath come on, such an one as belike Noah himself never witnessed. "" So saying she buried her head under her wing, a prey to terror. The husband, on his return, hastened to the parrot to ask what had happened during his absence; and the bird answered that she found it impossible to describe the deluge and tempest of the last night; and that years would be required to explain the uproar of the hurricane and storm. When the shopkeeper heard the parrot talk of last night's deluge, he said: ""Surely O bird, thou art gone clean daft!)"" And he swept away the parrot with the whirlwind.

There is a town a few miles distant from the Eastern Sea, near which are those celebrated waters commonly called Gipse. A peasant of this town went once to see a friend who lived in the next town, and it was late at night when he was coming back, not very sober; when lo! from the adjoining barrow, which I have often seen, and which is not much over a quarter of a mile from the town, he heard the voices of people singing, and, as it were, joyfully feasting. He wondered who they could be that were breaking in that place, by their merriment, the silence of the dead night, and he wished to examine into the matter more closely. Seeing a door open in the side of the barrow, he went up to it, and looked in; and there he beheld a large and luminous house, full of people, women as well as men, who were reclining as at a solemn banquet. One of the attendants, seeing him standing at the door, offered him a cup. He took it, but would not drink; and pouring out the contents, kept the vessel. A great tumult arose at the banquet on account of his taking away the cup, and all the guests pursued him; but he escaped by the fleetness of the beast he rode, and got into the town with his booty. Finally, this vessel of unknown material, of unusual colour, and of extraordinary form, was presented to Henry the Elder, King of the English, as a valuable gift, and was then given to the queen's brother David, King of the Scots, and was kept for several years in the treasury of Scotland; and a few years ago (as I have heard from good authority), it was given by William, King of the Scots, to Henry the Second, who wished to see it.",0.6926412661650473,0.6926412661650473,0.0,0.0

In a grovy lawn of this forest there is a little mount, rising in a point to the height of a man, on which knights and other hunters are used to ascend when fatigued with heat and thirst, to seek some relief for their wants. The nature of the place, and of the business, is, however, such, that whoever ascends the mount must leave his companions, and go quite alone. When alone, he was to say, as if speaking to some other person, ""I thirst,"" and immediately there would appear a cup-bearer in an elegant dress, with a cheerful countenance, bearing in his stretched-out hand a large horn, adorned with gold and gems, as was the custom among the most ancient English. In the cup nectar of an unknown but most delicious flavour was presented, and when it was drunk, all heat and weariness fled from the glowing body, so that one would be thought ready to undertake toil instead of haying toiled. Moreover, when the nectar was taken, the servant presented a towel to the drinker, to wipe his mouth with, and then having performed his office, he waited neither for a recompense for his services, nor for questions and enquiry.

After passing charming points too numerous to mention, the road, which rises rapidly, leads over the barren Grimsel Pass, where stands a famous refuge for poor travellers, the well-known Grimsel Hospice. A legend claims that in olden times this region blossomed like the rose, and that the highest mountains were as fertile as any valley nestling in a sheltered location at their foot. When Our Lord bade the Wandering Jew [footnote: See the author's Legends of the Virgin and Christ . ] begin the never-ending journey for which he is so noted, he immediately set out, and tramping incessantly, started to cross the Alps at the Grimsel. Although constantly urged along by a power he could not resist, Ahasuerus, the Jew, marked the happy people dwelling on the banks of the Aare and the Rhône, and marvelled at the extreme fertility of the pass, where grapes and figs grew in abundance, where no barren spot could be seen, and where mighty oaks covered the tops of mountains now crowned by eternal snows. The air was mild and balmy, even at the greatest altitude; and hosts of birds in bright plumage flitted about, twittering and singing in the merriest way. Ahasuerus also noticed that the people were gentle and hospitable, for wherever he asked for food or drink it was quickly granted, and he was warmly invited to tarry with them and rest his weary limbs. This invitation, however, he could not accept; but hurried on, unconscious of the fact that a blight fell over every place through which he passed; for the curse laid upon him not only condemned him to move on for ever, but enhanced his punishment by making cold, want, and pestilence follow in his train. Many years passed by before the Wandering Jew again found himself near the Alps; but weary as he was, he somewhat quickened his footsteps, hoping to feast his eyes upon the landscape which had so charmed him the first time, and to meet again the warm-hearted people who had been so kind to him once before. As he drew near the mountains, however, sad forebodings wrung his heart, for they were enveloped in a dense fog, which seemed to him particularly cold and clammy. Hurrying on up the pass, he eagerly looked from side to side, yet saw nothing but dark pines wildly tossing their sombre branches against a gray sky, while ravens and owls flew past him, croaking and hooting. Vines, figs, and oaks had vanished, and the happy people, driven away by the constant windstorms which swept the mountains, had taken refuge in the sheltered valleys. But although all else was changed, the spirit of hospitality still lingered on the heights, for the charcoal-burners gladly shared their meagre supply of coarse food with the Wandering Jew, and warmly invited him to be seated at their campfire. The Jew, however, had to hasten on; and many long years elapsed before he again trod the Grimsel Pass. For a while he still perceived dark firs and smouldering fires, but it seemed to him that they were much nearer the foot of the mountain than they had been at his second visit. As he climbed upward he also noticed that the path was much more rugged than before, for rocks and stones had fallen down upon it from above, making it almost impassable in certain places. As no obstacle could stop this involuntary traveller, he went on over rolling stones and jagged rocks, and nearing the top of the pass discovered that every trace of vegetation had vanished, and that the place formerly so fertile was now covered with barren rocks and vast fields of snow. Raising his eyes to the peaks all around him he perceived that oaks, beeches, and pines had all vanished, and that the steep mountain sides were heavily coated with ice, which ran far down into the valleys in great frozen streams. The sight of all this desolation, which had taken the place of such luxuriant vegetation, proved too much for poor Ahasuerus, who sank down on a rock by the wayside and burst into tears.

The two burghers took counsel together how they might cheat their companion of his share, and proposed that whichever of the three should have the most wonderful dream while the bread was baking should have the loaf all to himself. Thinking thus to deceive the peasant, they placed the dough in the ashes and lay down to sleep. But the peasant saw through their trick, arose and ate the loaf when it was half baked, and lay down again. Then one of the burghers, as though frightened by his dream, awoke and called the other. ""What's the matter?"" ""I've had a wonderful dream. Two angels opened the gates of heaven and brought me before the Lord. "" ""That is a splendid dream,"" replied the other; ""but I dreamed that two angels came, clove the earth asunder, and took me into hell.

The servant immediately became suspicious and rushed back to investigate the wagon. He pulled his own fiancée from beneath the wagon tarp. Her mouth had been bound with a cloth. The servant carried her to safety and then untied her hands and feet. The robbers soon emerged from the house and drove off as fast as their horses could run, thinking that they were carrying with them a rich booty. Narrative 2 Once a rogue slipped into a house during the day. The inhabitants of the house saw him, but although they searched high and low, they could not find him. At nightfall the inhabitants went to bed, but the servant girl could not fall asleep. She was afraid of the stranger, and wanted to look around carefully one last time. To her fright she discovered him hiding in the stove. The girl then pretended to fall asleep. Now that all was quiet in the house, the rogue climbed out of the stove and ignited as many lights as there were people in the house. But one of the lights would not burn. He believed that the girl was not yet asleep and held a burning light against her feet. However, in her fear she withstood the pain and did not move. Now satisfied, the rogue placed all the lights on the table and went outside to summon his fellow robbers. The girl jumped up and barred the door shut behind him. She attempted to awaken the people in the house, but to no avail. She then tried to extinguish the lights, but failed to do this as well. The rogue came to the window and demanded his lights, promising to leave once he had them. The servant girl answered that she could not reach them out to him while there were burning. She said that she had been unable to put them out and asked him what to do. He told her to submerge them in fresh milk. That is exactly what she wanted to know. She submerged them in fresh milk, and the lights went out. She shouted at the fellow that he was not going to get his lights back, and he then did indeed have to made a hasty retreat, for as soon as the lights were extinguished, everyone in the house awoke, and they all came running to see what was the matter.",0.81316701985197,0.81316701985197,0.0,0.0

However, he did not die for several years afterwards; and miserable years many of them were. Besides the weariness of old age, the old fellow had to bear with much abuse and cruelty from his sons. Wretched, selfish ingrates! Previously they vied with one another in trying to please their father, hoping thus to receive more money, but now they had received their patrimony, they cared not how soon he left them -- nay, the sooner the better, because he was only a needless trouble and expense. This, as we may suppose, was a great grief to the old man. One day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles. The friend sympathized very much with him, and promised to think over the matter, and call in a little while and tell him what to do. He did so; in a few days he visited the old man and put down four bags full of stones and gravel before him. ""Look here, friend,"" said he.

In common language they are called ""thunderbolts,"" ""thunder-arrows,"" or sometimes ""devil-fingers. "" It is believed that during thunderstorms they are hurled to the earth with lightning. A person killed by lightning is struck by a thunderbolt carried by the lightning. Another belief is that a thunderbolt is created when lightning strikes the earth. Thus thunderbolts are only found in places where lightning has struck the earth. Thunderbolts are collected with enthusiasm and then kept at home, for it is believed that a thunder-arrow protects a house from lightning. People especially like to keep them in their milk rooms. Stomach-aches can be cured by scraping off and swallowing a little of the thunderbolt. The toadstone, a fossilized sea-urchin, is also considered to be a proven protective agent against lightning, and is therefore kept at home, especially in milk rooms. The farmers of Rügen often place in their swine troughs the ball-shaped stone kernels of the sea-urchin (ananchytes ovatus) that are often found in chalk. These presumably aid in the fattening of the swine and also protect the animals from red murrain.

When the youth was taken to the emperor's bedroom, he was asked why he had come and not his master. The young man replied that the master was ill, and there was no one but himself who could be trusted with the honor. The emperor was satisfied with the answer, and sat down, and let a sheet of fine linen be put round him. Directly the young barber began his work, he, like the rest, remarked the goat's ears of the emperor, but when he had finished and the emperor asked his usual question as to whether the youth had noticed anything odd about him, the young man replied calmly, ""No, nothing at all. "" This pleased the emperor so much that he gave him twelve ducats, and said, ""Henceforth you shall come every day to shave me. "" So when the apprentice returned home, and the master inquired how he had got on with the emperor, the young man answered, ""Oh, very well, and he says I am to shave him every day, and he has given me these twelve ducats""; but he said nothing about the goat's ears of the emperor. From this time the apprentice went regularly up to the palace, receiving each morning twelve ducats in payment. But after a while, his secret, which he had carefully kept, burnt within him, and he longed to tell it to somebody. His master saw there was something on his mind, and asked what it was. The youth replied that he had been tormenting himself for some months, and should never feel easy until some one shared his secret. ""Well, trust me,"" said the master, ""I will keep it to myself; or, if you do not like to do that, confess it to your pastor, or go into some field outside the town and dig a hole, and, after you have dug it, kneel down and whisper your secret three times into the hole. Then put back the earth and come away. "" The apprentice thought that this seemed the best plan, and that very afternoon went to a meadow outside the town, dug a deep hole, then knelt and whispered to it three times over, ""The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears. "" And as he said so a great burden seemed to roll off him, and he shoveled the earth carefully back and ran lightly home. Weeks passed away, and there sprang up in the hole an elder tree which had three stems, all as straight as poplars. Some shepherds, tending their flocks near by, noticed the tree growing there, and one of them cut down a stem to make flutes of; but, directly he began to play, the flute would do nothing but sing: ""The Emperor Trojan has goat's ears. "" Of course, it was not long before the whole town knew of this wonderful flute and what it said; and, at last, the news reached the emperor in his palace. He instantly sent for the apprentice and said to him, ""What have you been saying about me to all my people?""

A beautiful female stepped forth, and presented to the guest a drinking horn and a pipe, requesting him to drink the troll-king's health and to blow in the pipe. He took the horn and pipe, but at the same instant clapped spurs to his horse, and galloped straight, over rough and smooth, to the mansion. The trolls followed him in a body with a wild cry of threats and prayers, but the man kept the start, and delivered both horn and pipe into the hands of his mistress. The trolls promised prosperity and riches to Fru Cissela's race, if she would restore their pipe and horn; but she persisted in keeping them, and they are still preserved at Liungby, as memorials of the wonderful event. The horn is said to be of an unknown mixture of metals with brass ornaments, and the pipe of a horse's leg-bone. The man who stole them from the trolls died three days after, and the horse on the second day. Liungby mansion has been twice burnt, and the Ulftand family never prospered afterwards. This tradition teaches that Christians should act justly even towards trolls. It is also related of some priests, who were riding before daybreak by a mount on a cold frosty day, while the trolls were at their sports, how a berg- or mount-woman came out and offered them drink in metal bowls; and how they cast the drink behind them, but that some drops chanced to fall on the horses' loins and burned the hair off. The bowls they carried away with them, and such are still to be found in several churches, where, it is said, they were formerly used as chalices. This drink, which the trolls were in the habit of offering so liberally, was believed to have the property of obliterating from the memory all the past, and of rendering the guest who partook of it contented with all he met with in the mount.",0.6996731531734657,0.6996731531734657,0.0,0.0

In remembrance of this deed, the king commanded him to call himself Trolle, and to take a troll without a head for his armorial bearing. Such is the origin of the noble name of Trolle.

He wondered who they could be that were breaking in that place, by their merriment, the silence of the dead night, and he wished to examine into the matter more closely. Seeing a door open in the side of the barrow, he went up to it, and looked in; and there he beheld a large and luminous house, full of people, women as well as men, who were reclining as at a solemn banquet. One of the attendants, seeing him standing at the door, offered him a cup. He took it, but would not drink; and pouring out the contents, kept the vessel. A great tumult arose at the banquet on account of his taking away the cup, and all the guests pursued him; but he escaped by the fleetness of the beast he rode, and got into the town with his booty. Finally, this vessel of unknown material, of unusual colour, and of extraordinary form, was presented to Henry the Elder, King of the English, as a valuable gift, and was then given to the queen's brother David, King of the Scots, and was kept for several years in the treasury of Scotland; and a few years ago (as I have heard from",0.6901899002605738,0.6901899002605738,0.0,0.0

Respecting the building, the legend which nearly all Kirkby people will tell you, is as follows: A cow belonging to a poor woman had strayed across the river at some convenient wading place, and not having returned with the town herd at milking time, the woman went forth to seek her. In the meantime the water had risen considerably, and, not being able to cross the river, the woman was in a dilemma, for her good man, a laborer, and her cow, were on the opposite side. At this juncture the devil, in human form, appeared on the other bank, no doubt assuming the soft guile of the tempter, promised to build a bridge, on condition that the first living thing which passed over should become his lawful prize; to this the woman gladly assented. Darkness deepened rapidly -- necessary for diabolical thought and deed, which in this instance was frustrated by the forethought of the woman, whose husband or herself had been singled out for the victim which was to propitiate the building of the bridge. At the appointed hour she returned, bringing with her a dog, and a delicious morsel wherewith to tempt it. The bridge was complete, and there stood his sable majesty, anxiously awaiting his victim. Suddenly, across the bridge, she threw the tempting morsel, and after it sprang the dog. The devil, seeing how cleverly he had been outwitted, gave forth a terrific howl, which aroused all the inhabitants in the old town, who at once rushed down to the river to ascertain the cause, thinking there had been an earthquake, instead of which they were agreeably astonished to find a substantial bridge, across which the woman, accompanied by her husband and dog, were driving the cow. And there still stands the remarkable structure to witness or attest the truth, as story says, if I lie, and as a further proof, below the bridge is still to be seen the Devil's Neck Collar -- a rock with a large perforation, which he lost from his neck in that wild unearthly plunge from the bridge, on finding his hellish scheme thwarted.",0.6583759296639693,0.6583759296639693,0.0,0.0

At times he was nervously afraid of losing his dear wife, and at others burning with impatience for the struggle. At last the old fort with its dark high bushy fences cutting against the sky, was in a moment replaced by a palace and its court. A thousand lights flashed from the windows and lofty hall entrance; numerous torches were brandished by attendants stationed round the courtyard; and a numerous cavalcade of richly attired ladies and gentlemen was moving in the direction of the gate where he found himself standing. As they rode by him laughing and jesting, he could not tell whether they were aware of his presence or not. He looked intent at each countenance as it approached, but it was some time before he caught sight of the dear face and figure borne along on a milk-white steed. She recognized him well enough, and her features now broke into a smile -- now expressed deep anxiety. She was unable for the throng to guide the animal close to the ring of power; so he suddenly rushed out of his bounds, seized her in his arms, and lifted her off. Cries of rage and fury arose on every side; they were hemmed in, and weapons were directed at his head and breast to terrify him. He seemed to be inspired with superhuman courage and force, and wielding the powerful knife he soon cleared a space round him, all seeming dismayed by the sight of the weapon. He lost no time, but drew his wife within the ring, within which none of the myriads round dared to enter. Shouts of derision and defiance continued to fill the air for some time, but the expedition could not be delayed. As the end of the procession filed past the gate and the circle within which the mortal pair held each other determinedly clasped, darkness and silence fell on the old rath and the fields round it, and the rescued bride and her lover breathed freely.

Witches are, indeed, generally laid to rest in some sort of a crouching or sitting posture, and there is a curious stuck upness and mournful air about the haunted places which they influence. The fate of one Thomas Evans, so long associated with South Gloucestershire, seems to prove this; his gentle soul having escaped from the evil art, found its way to a better world, and found rest in the peaceful pond which is nestled in the hill-side beside his ancestral home. Legend has it that at some former period of its history the place had been frequented by devils, who had their pit in the midst of it, and who, for the capture of the inquisitive little angel, gave the inhabitants frightful shocks of heat and of lightning. But as the devil is a conjuration, and the inhabitants, if they heard any one approaching, had been convinced by the displayed power of the house over its enemies, they had taken every precaution to clear the room of all suspected magic, and Tom's reedy back had been secured with chains of brass and iron. It was a pretty little pond, the water being sweet and healthy, and full of fish. Another story says, that a scandal reached the nest at the Black Horse, when Tom, or some old lady very intimate with him, having fallen suddenly ill, and scarce knowing where to turn, took his party, and turning around, found his wife stretched out on the green, almost dying of heat, and Tom, quite wild with his excitement, began hacking at her with his hatchet.

One dark night when all the neighbors were sound asleep a loud knocking at the house door had awakened the woman. She jumped up and peered through the window, but she could see nothing except for a lantern in front of the house. Then a voice called out, ""Throw on your clothes and come with me. A woman is in need of your service!"" The midwife did what she had been asked, went down, and with hesitating steps followed the lantern, which was already one street ahead of her. She could not see the person who was carrying it. Thus it went through several streets, then out through the convent gate, and then a good way beyond the town. Finally the light stopped moving. A hidden trapdoor opened, and many steps led underground. Trembling and praying, the midwife followed her mysterious leader, and before long she found herself in a roomy chamber surrounded by elves, who cordially welcomed her. Before she had time to recover from her surprise, one of the little people stepped up to her and asked her to follow him to the woman for whose sake she had been summoned. Soon afterward a tiny, cute elf came to the world. Since mother and child were both doing well, the midwife hoped that she would be able to return to her own people the next morning. But that was not so. The elves did not want to let her go. Each day they treated her better than the day before, giving her everything that she could want. During this time the elves often went out, not returning unless they were loaded down with all kinds of pretty things. Before leaving they always rubbed their eyes with a liquid which they kept in a glass. The old woman noticed this, and once when the little people had gone out she found the glass and put a little of its contents on her right eye. In the meantime eight days had passed, and the elves no longer resisted the old woman's request. As soon as it was dark they allowed her to return home, saying, ""For your reward take along those sweepings behind the door!"" Smart enough to not despise the unusual gift, she brushed the sweepings into her apron. Then with good cheer she followed the lantern, which -- as had happened eight days earlier -- was carried on ahead by an invisible hand.

And it chanced that one of them, a curly-haired little man, was set to build a bridge over a stream which ran past the monastery. At the first glance he seemed to be no one: but as he took hold of some thin iron rods, which were standing in a reel, he became visible. He had to go home again in order to fulfill his promise, but the offer of a cup of beer extended to him a welcome relief. He took the rod in his hand, and accompanied by a merchant, walked across the bridge. And a little farther on, another man, more lowly in his garments, came to ask for a drink. When he took hold of the rod which kept hanging from his neck, a dusky little figure appeared in the water. He demanded the drink from them, and held his tongue while the vile little man greedily drank from his poisoned cup. Even when the drunkard began to exclaim in despair, the little man offered him a rag of thin iron in the form of a silver button. The belated warrior, however, while he took the button into his hand, was struck with fear and threw his glowering eyes upon the opposite bank.

The god Visvesvara and his spouse Visalakshi observed this and had pity for the unhappy pair; so by their divine power they blessed them with a son. This most welcome addition to their family did not alienate the affections of the Brahman and his wife from the mongoose; on the contrary, their attachment increased, for they believed that it was because of their having adopted the pet that a son had been conceived. So the child and the mongoose were brought up together, as twin brothers, in the same cradle. It happened one day when the Brahman had gone out to beg alms of the pious and charitable, that his wife went into the garden to cull some pot-herbs, leaving the child asleep in his cradle, and by his side the mongoose kept guard. An old serpent, which was living in the well in the garden, crept into the house and under the cradle, and was beginning to climb into it to bite the child when the mongoose fiercely attacked it and tore it into several pieces, thus saving the life of his son, and the venomous snake, that came to slay, itself lay dead beneath the cradle. Pleased at having performed such an exploit, the mongoose ran into the garden to show the Brahman's wife its blood-smeared mouth, but she rashly mistook the deliverer of her child for his destroyer, and with one stroke of the knife in her hand with which she was cutting herbs she killed the faithful creature, and then hastened into the house to see her dead son.

It happened one day that there was a running at tilt and tournament in the public place appointed for that purpose, to which this gentleman, amongst others, resorted.

One day the farmer was standing with his wife before the house door, and said, ""Tomorrow I intend to shoot Old Sultan. He is no longer of any use. "" His wife, who felt pity for the faithful animal, answered, ""He has served us so long, and been so faithful, that we might well give him his keep. "" ""What?"" said the man. ""You are not very bright. He doesn't have a tooth left in his mouth, and no thief is afraid of him. He can go now. If he has served us, he has eaten well for it. "" The poor dog, who was lying stretched out in the sun not far off, heard everything, and was sorry that tomorrow was to be his last day. He had a good friend, the wolf, and he crept out in the evening into the forest to him, and complained of the fate that awaited him. ""Listen, kinsman,"" said the wolf, ""be of good cheer. I will help you out of your trouble. I have thought of something. Tomorrow, early in the morning, your master is going with his wife to make hay, and they will take their little child with them, for no one will be left behind in the house. While they are at work they lay the child behind the hedge in the shade. You lie down there too, just as if you wanted to guard it. Then I will come out of the woods, and carry off the child. You must run swiftly after me, as if you would take it away from me. I will let it fall, and you will take it back to its parents, who will think that you have rescued it, and will be far too grateful to do you any harm. On the contrary, you will be treated royally, and they will never let you want for anything again. "" This idea pleased the dog, and it was carried out just as planned. The father screamed when he saw the wolf running across the field with his child, but when Old Sultan brought it back, he was full of joy, and stroked him and said, ""Not a hair of yours shall be hurt. You shall eat free bread as long as you live. "" And to his wife he said, ""Go home at once and make Old Sultan some bread soup that he will not have to bite. And bring the pillow from my bed.

In order to thwart the thief, who she saw daily, she brought the children to a large cave which lay between the neighboring villages. There the woman held them in tormentor's hands, but especially scolded her husband for not being more attentive to his business. One day the husbandman was out in the field and hadn't brought his wife home yet. She went to the cave and began to tear apart the wood with her sharp scissors, which were ripening on the fire. She had scarcely left the room when the husband came home and found his wife in the middle of the work. Unwilling to allow such wickedness in his midst, he called his wife to him and asked her to return to the cave and protest her reason for going. She brought the scissors to her husband and protested her innocence, but without succeeding in cutting her husband's hair. Now hardened in his purpose, the husbandman led her into the cave's entrance, tied her to a tree and forced her to remain there as a sacrifice to a giant. The woman did what she had been asked, saying that she wanted to leave her husband entirely alone, and she wanted to do just that. Fine was her husband's response, that she should be thankful that he had called her to that end, for otherwise she would not have come. If she had not come, he would not have needed to make up for the overnight shortness of his ship. On account of which, her kinsmen would not have been so good to her. Besides, it was not the first time that she had done something wickedly. She added that she had received such instructions from her dead husband. The man had been careful to feed his family well, providing everything for each individual, and he was too observant of his time and form to allow his wife to depart without making an appearance. At midnight the husband came home to find his wife alive and well and faithfully following his every move. She was crying bitterly, but able to hold in her tears. He hugged her and kissed her children before continuing with his journey. He had scarcely left the village when a great noise in the forest was heard to increase, finally taking on the form of six tall images. The husbandman knew that these were the coming enemies, and being somewhat frightened, he hastened home. Here he found on observing his wife closely combatting the images with her scissors. Attempting to restrain her, he caught her in his arms and lifted her up against the trunk of a tree. She fought against him so hard that he struck her four times with his wooden paddle, and then threw her into the roots of a tree. Having accomplished this miracle, the husband returned home to make up for lost time. Before departing, he told his wife to be careful not to lose her balance and fall down into the ravine; otherwise, he would be harmed. Evelyna thanked him and wept for having spared her life. She also complained that she had to perform this miracle at such a distance, and in such a warm and friendly manner. Adam refused to give up his claims, and offered to give Evelyna the benefit of the doubt, claiming that she was a human being like himself. Adam also asked Evelyna if she would be so good as to lead him home, so he could give his children a decent upbringing. She replied that she would do so, if he would just allow her to come and go as she pleased. Adam smiled and said that this was what he had in mind. Some time after this, the sea began to swirl and transform itself into a giantess. She followed Adam's instructions and climbed into the sea, only to disappear within it. Adam then climbed onto her back, gave her a child and also rode on her like a horse. They were making their way toward the shore when suddenly she stood still and was carried away by the sea. This happened every time that they left the channel. Adam nervously tried to prevent her from following them, but she escaped every time by some means. She finally made her way to the mainland and, to cut a long story short, became the prime suspect in a robbery that was going on in Rügen at the time. She ran away and left a sum of money for him. On discovering this, the heisters immediately fell upon her and beat her with kicks and blows, until she turned into a mere living statue. She was then put on display in a kiln and brought to life again.

When she had crossed the river, she inquired the way; and whenever she spoke the hump on her back mimicked her voice and repeated what she said, as if, instead of a hump on her back, she had an echoing stone there. Some of the folks she met laughed, and others were angry, thinking that she was mocking them, so that at last there was nothing to be done but to pretend to be mute. In this state she went on her way begging, until she arrived at a city that belonged to the prince for whom she had taken so great a liking. She went to the palace to ask them to employ her, and she was taken on as a maidservant. The prince saw her, and was so struck with her beauty that he said: ""That girl has such a beautiful face that if she were not a hunchback and mute, I would marry her. "" The prince's marriage with a foreign princess was much talked about, so the pain and jealousy of the hunchback, who became every day more enamoured of the heir to the kingdom, may be well imagined. At last the matrimonial contract was arranged with another princess, who was as upright as a dart and as talkative as a magpie. The prince went forth with a grand retinue to bring her home, and great preparations were made in the palace for the wedding. The supposed mute had to fry some cakes; and as she was frying them she said to her hump: ""Dear little hump, would you like a nice little cake?"" The hump, which was that of an old man very fond of sweet things, replied that it would like it. ""Then look into my pocket,"" said she. The hump made a leap off her back to her pocket, when the princess, who was already prepared with the tongs in her hand, seized the hump and popped it into the boiling oil, where it quickly melted into a lump of lard.

At length, after they had waited patiently till it came into the room, till it must have climbed a great flight of steps, the cat entered the room, and sat down on the left side of the bed. The men placed themselves behind the door and began to shoot at will. The cat continued to sit for some time after the shooting began, and during the whole time nobody was hurt, though the bullets must have done considerable damage. At last the terrified hunters ventured to go to the cat's quarters, and hung up a leaflet (they had been taught to say what was going to be the result of the result, and to keep without saying what they thought the cat would do), on which was written, in English letters, THE APPLICATION IS PLEASANT.   The result was that the cat got up and went out of the doorway, off which the hunters could not shoot her. Finding she had got up, they got off their guns, and walked calmly past her to the door, when she came down and curled up at the door to see what was the matter. They could not hit her, however, till they went into the house, and the widower's first care was to comfort his wife for the frightfulness of the situation.

The bride, however, soon lost her head and rushed out of the house, not carrying the letter through the door. There were many who expected to see it, but no one could explain its arrival, and the birth of a child was supposed to be connected with the arrival of the leaf. It was the custom to kill a leaf at the period before a new mother was married, or during the first seven days after the birth of a child, and a borrowed or stolen leaf was deemed to be the cause of all kinds of misfortune. The leaf being secret, and the couple never meeting, it was presumed that the unlucky couple had several children, who for many years dwelt in a farm or two-roomed house, and were in great anguish, because they could not see or hear their parents. This anguish was increased when, in the course of time, one of the children discovered the secret. He would often hide himself and read when all the other boys were busy at work. Some persons found it difficult to explain this strange behavior, and at last they made the mistake of considering the boy as a messenger from his parents, and as such was treated with much more respect. After a while the parents got used to the child's coming, and began to expect it every day. The day before he always appeared, the boys game was to run around the church in order to see him, but no one ever saw him. At last, however, one day, when all the servants were present, and the boy was expected, they were all pretty frightened, especially when he said he would hide in the hayloft until they came, but consented to come out on the bridge to see the house that day. So the little party went out, and in the evening the boy came out on the bridge, but did not go into the house, but went straight to the farmyard, and down to the water's level, so that none of the chatties of milk and butter could touch him.

Shortly before Christmas, Peer set out again on another expedition. He had heard of a farm on Dovrefell which was invaded by such a number of trolls every Christmas Eve that the people on the farm had to move out, and get shelter at some of their neighbors. He was anxious to go there, for he had a great fancy to come across the trolls again. He dressed himself in some old ragged clothes, and took a tame white bear, which he had, with him, as well as an awl, some pitch, and twine. When he came to the farm he went in and asked for lodgings. ""God help us!"" said the farmer; "" we can't give you any lodgings. We have to clear out of the house ourselves soon and look for lodgings, for every Christmas Eve we have the trolls here. "" But Peer thought he should be able to clear the trolls out -- he had done such a thing before; and then he got leave to stay, and a pig's skin into the bargain. The bear lay down behind the fireplace, and Peer took out his awl, and pitch, and twine, and began making a big, big shoe, which it took the whole pig's skin to make. He put a strong rope in for laces, that he might pull the shoe tightly together, and, finally, he armed himself with a couple of handspikes. Shortly he heard the trolls coming. They had a fiddler with them, and some began dancing, while others fell to eating the Christmas fare on the table -- some fried bacon, and some fried frogs and toads, and other nasty things which they had brought with them. During this some of the trolls found the shoe Peer had made. They thought it must belong to a very big foot. They all wanted to try it on at once, so they put a foot each into it; but Peer made haste and tightened the rope, took one of the handspikes and fastened the rope round it, and got them at last securely tied up in the shoe. Just then the bear put his nose out from behind the fireplace, where he was lying, and smelt they were frying something. ""Will you have a sausage, pussy?"" said one of the trolls, and threw a hot frog right into the bear's jaw. ""Scratch them, pussy,"" said Peer The bear got so angry that he rushed at the trolls and scratched them all over, while Peer took the other handspike and hammered away at them as if he wanted to beat their brains out. The trolls had to clear out at last, but Peer stayed and enjoyed himself with all the Christmas fare the whole week. After that the trolls were not heard of there for many years. Some years afterwards, about Christmastime, the farmer was out in the forest cutting wood for the holidays, when a troll came up to him and shouted: ""Have you got that big pussy of yours, yet?""

He was given a task which was too great for him, and he was ordered to build a palace for the dwarf people. However, he was not able to do it, however much he tried. Then he died in despair. Now at that time no people lived in the palace. The emperor was the grandfather of the princess, and he told the prince that he had built this palace for them. The little princess wanted to know how she might solve the problem, and she asked her father how she might solve it. He told her to take her little hand through the hole, and if she could guess his name from the name of the person who sent her home, she would not need to do anything. The girl took her little hand through the hole, and she replied, ""It is my name is Hipche, Hipche. "" Then the dwarf people recommended her to the prince, who was standing outside the door, and he said to her, ""Your name is Hipche, Hipche. "" Then the dwarf people recommended her to the prince, who was standing in their midst. He said, ""The palace has no walls, and thus one cannot get inside it. But if you could give me a light for my candle, in return I would keep your name as a secret. "" With this the girl became his slave, and remained with him and became his wife. They lived well together and had many children. After the way their marriage was coming on, the young man felt himself being overtaken by grave robbers. Therefore he quickly turned himself into a tombstone, and while he was in this form, the robbers came and took him. Fortunately he escaped, and came out on the monastery road in the dark. Suddenly he saw a light approaching him, and saying, ""Habrún the Unknown, the Wise, and the Prince of the Ladies, Come hither and buy my candle. "" The man said, ""Who can be your name?"" ""It is my name,"" she answered, ""Habrún the Unknown, the Wise, and the Prince of the Ladies. "" The man said, ""What! Does she know something that I know?"" ""She has told me what she knew. "" The man thought that this woman was dead, and he did not dare go home. Instead he waited one more night. The woman returned, and said, ""The man is gone. He went out and sought another place to kill the old man. "" The man thought, ""He could have taken me and eaten me. I would have been his meal.

In the night the devil came to her in the form of her beloved, and he called upon her to pledge her soul to him. In return he would accompany her, in this form, as long as she lived. Further, he would give her great magic power. She agreed to this, and the devil remained with her. He was not exactly invisible, but still secret, and no one knew about him. After a while he advised her to enter a convent, which she did. She would now lock herself in her cell with her beloved, while her phantom form was praying in the church. She gained the reputation of great piety, and soon afterward became the abbess. From this time forward miraculous events began to occur in the convent. Most prominently, from time to time several nuns were attacked with long-lasting and unknown ailments, which she was able to cure through her apparent intercession. Thus her holy reputation grew ever greater. The first suspicion came from several children who always visited the convent. The abbess, who loved children, would show them magic tricks whenever she was alone with them. She told others about this, although she had strictly forbidden them to do so. Above all, the abbess would ask the children if they would like her to make some little mice for them, whereupon the table would immediately be crawling with small, tame mice. The children were too young for one to give much credibility to their talk, but once a young nun, on her way to church, passed by the abbess's cell and heard the abbess whispering lightly with a man's voice. Curious, she looked through the keyhole and saw the abbess and an officer. But when she entered the church she saw the abbess's form praying there before the altar, and she feinted with fright.

This son struck his father, And he has as a reward, That his hand is hanging here. Guard thyself from such shame. On the tablet's edge, encircling the inscription, are the words: Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. Beneath the tablet there is an iron chain, about a half yard long, from which is hanging a human hand, which was cut off at its root. Its color is ashen gray; its skin and flesh are totally dry. The following legend is told about it: Before the Thirty Years' War there lived in Groß-Rebensleben a pious man who had a very wayward son. This son not only ridiculed his father's admonitions, but his belligerence went so far that he abused his own father. Once he even lifted his hand against him as the father was praying to God for his repentance. And it came to pass that the wayward son suddenly fell dead to the earth, as a visible sign that Heaven would not allow his wickedness to go unpunished. He was buried the next day, and then an even greater miracle occurred. Suddenly a hand appeared from the grave, the same hand with which he had struck his father, as if it could find no rest beneath the earth. All who saw this happen fled in terror, and no one dared return to the churchyard, for the hand did not return to beneath the earth. It was a gruesome sight, the way it extended from the grave, stiff, pale, cold, and silent, but still an articulate witness as to how the Lord punishes sin. At last the authorities ordered that the hand be whipped with switches, in the belief that such a punishment would suffice and would lead to redemption. The order was carried out, and the hand bled until the earth turned red, but it would not return to the grave. Then they had it chopped off and hung it in the church with the tablet described above so that it could serve as a lesson for future generations.",0.6490020934299947,0.7490020934299947,-0.1,0.0

So he waited until he had summoned all the servants to his house, and as they were going forth to visit certain friends, he placed before each one a hymnbook with him, and read to them, when he found himself alone with the twelve. And as he read the book he laughed heartily; and as soon as he had finished the book, he said: ""There is none so great as this world, but there is also a second, and a second is mine.

One day the bird which had nowhere to light grew tired of flying about, so she stirred up the sea until it threw its waters against the sky. The sky, in order to restrain the sea, showered upon it many islands until it could no longer rise, but ran back and forth. Then the sky ordered the kite to light on one of the islands to build her nest, and to leave the sea and the sky in peace. Now at this time the land breeze and the sea breeze were married, and they had a child which was a bamboo. One day when this bamboo was floating about on the water, it struck the feet of the kite which was on the beach. The bird, angry that anything should strike it, pecked at the bamboo, and out of one section came a man and from the other a woman. Then the earthquake called on all the birds and fish to see what should be done with these two, and it was decided that they should marry. Many children were born to the couple, and from them came all the different races of people. After a while the parents grew very tired of having so many idle and useless children around, and they wished to be rid of them, but they knew of no place to send them to.

In the video, titled ""Don't Hang Up,"" he explains that he simply cannot believe that there are people today that cannot give up on a girl. ""There are people for whom one night stands are commonplace, and yet when I try to get any girl I can for one night I'm met with failure,"" he said. ""A friend of mine was in the same boat as me. He had once been in a relationship with a girl for a number of months. One time he was out with a new girl from a new town. And he was so enthralled that he failed to tell her that he had to go and see his girlfriend. His girlfriend came back and overheard the conversation, and asked Rufus to come over for dinner. Rufus refused, and this caused her to call him a slut. He then realized it was his fault and told her what was happening. Then, he admitted that he had gotten drunk, and as a result of being with the girl, had gotten a huge erection, which was causing him to want to have sex with her, but was afraid to tell her. She was angry at this. She took the video of the two of them together and posted it on the internet to show others how to avoid this mistake. From that day until this present, he has never looked at a girl the same way. ""Now look,"" he said. ""You have never told your girlfriend that you can't get her to have sex with you. So here is what I will tell you. There are people today who do not know what is right and wrong. They just want to have sex, and they will say or do anything to get it. You have to learn to not give in to their bad advice. I will come up with a few of my own suggestions. First of all: don't hang yourself. If she hasn't yet had a sexual experience, don't try to force it on her. She may not like it. Second: don't take yourself out of the situation. Tell her that you have to see your girlfriend. Go to a party, and call her. You tell her you don't have to come, and then you meet up and have sex. If she doesn't like the sex, tell her how you're doing, and if she says you put out a lot of effort she will help you get it done. She may think you're kidding. That's okay.

Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) rose UNK% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of the year to C$UNK billion, the National Statistical Office said on Friday. SPONSORED That comes after four straight quarters of decline -- the longest stretch of contraction since the depths of the global financial crisis. German officials have not specified a reason for the acceleration in growth, which is still about half what it was at its peak in mid/late 2008. The country is now expected to grow by a disappointing UNK% in the second quarter. ""The economy of the eurozone has finally started to recover,"" the head of Germany's statistical office, Steffen Seibert, told Bild newspaper on Friday. ""The good news is that growth in the first quarter was faster than it was for the entire year of 2013. We know that it can only be better if there is stability in financial markets,"" he added. ""But the bad news is that the country is not at a stable pace yet,"" Seibert said. ""The euro has already sunk, and the euro-area has hit the bottom,"" he said. ""The real crisis may lie ahead. "" German Economy Secretary Gerhard Schindler agreed with Seibert, telling Der Spiegel that for the time being, the economic situation in the eurozone was deteriorating. ""The recovery in the eurozone is still slow enough that we have to be cautious,"" he said. ""The euro area as a whole is still suffering from the recession that followed the financial crisis,"" he said. ""The region is still struggling to come to terms with the worst and worst crisis since the Second World War,"" he warned.

Thus it is with the Raven Stone, which many people talk about, but no one knows anything about with certainty. But it is known for sure that Raven Stones exist. You have heard about Thieves' Lights. They are similar to the Raven Stone and other invisible thieves' lanterns. It is gruesome to relate how Thieves' Lights are obtained. They are the fingers of unborn, innocent little children. For these purposes the fingers of already born and baptized children cannot be used. And what sort of unborn little children are they? And how does one obtain the lights? When a female thief or murderer hangs or drowns herself, or is hanged or beheaded, and she is carrying a child inside her body, then you must go forth at midnight on the devil's roads, not on God's roads, with incantations and magic, not with prayer and blessings, and you must take an axe or a knife that has been used by an executioner, and with it you must open up the poor sinner's belly, take out the child, cut off its fingers, and take them with you. But this absolutely must all be done at midnight in the most perfect solitude and silence. Not even the softest sound, no ""oh"" and no sigh can escape the lips of the seeker. In this manner you obtain the lights, which you can use for any purpose you please. And however short they are, they will never burn up, but will always remain the same length. These magic lights have the unusual nature and property that they ignite whenever and wherever their thievish owner wants them to. And they extinguish themselves as fast as his wish and thought. With their help he can see everything, even in the densest and darkest night, whenever and wherever he wants. But they shine only for him and for no one else. He himself remains invisible, even though they illuminate everything else. Further, the horror within them gives them a mysterious power over sleep.

The owner of the fish heard all this, and came out, and gave him the civilly expected penalty. Two nights after, two magicians, disporting themselves in the company of a lying-woman, of the kind that the country women commonly are, heard the same thing. They gave the poor woman that had been scolded by her husband a material scolding, and then turned their attention to the richer lady, who stood by as witness. The woman, observing this, and recognizing in it the signal for her husband to join in with the rest of the revels, went to her chamber, took her husband's place, and pretended to be asleep. She saw everything, and heard the worse. She felt sure that nothing could be effected between them, until her husband, awakening her, said, ""My mother has gone to bed.

A public meeting of the citizens had been called to decide once and for all whether to attempt continued but futile resistance against the animals or to simply abandon one's belongings, which in truth were no longer belongings at all. There were spirited arguments back and forth when suddenly and unexpectedly a man stepped before the judge's bench and stated that he possessed the means to put an end to the city's plague. No one knew him, but his offer was accepted with loud acclaim. Everyone looked forward with fond anticipation to the next morning, when the promised rescue was to take place. In return for his deed the rescuer was to be paid a large sum of money. As the cock crowed the man did indeed enter at the gate. He was wearing an unusual hunting outfit and carrying a very large hunter's bag. He pulled from the bag a small black transverse flute, upon which he played mournful melodies. Hoards of rats and mice followed the flute's sound, emerging in great masses from their holes in every corner of every house in the city. They followed the flute player, who walked directly toward the Danube. There he stepped into a boat and -- continuing to play the flute -- rode to the middle of the stream. Irresistibly attracted to the music, the rats attempted to swim after him, but they all drowned in the river's raging current. Thus Korneuburg was saved. The piper now returned and asked for the agreed payment. Someone asked him who he was. ""I came here from Vienna,"" he said, ""because I heard of your need. My name is Hans Mousehole, and I am the official rat killer of Magdalenengrund [a former suburb of Vienna, now part of the Mariahilf district]. "" ""Any fool can say that,"" answered a most wise councilman. ""We know full well that your help is not of this world. Are you in league with the Evil One? Now see here, there is no obligation to keep one's word with black magicians or kobolds, so just take your leave, or we will turn you over to a witches' court. "" ""My dear people,"" replied the ratcatcher, ""your sense of honor is remarkable, for it seems to be directed at saving you money. But hear me out. You have no right to question the means by which I saved your city from the plague. It is sufficient that it is free. I have no intention of allowing myself to be chased out of your city, and I am even less inclined to reveal to you the inner workings of my deeds, which seemed so miraculous to you. Take note that there are not merely evil, but also good higher powers. I used the latter to do good for you, for good things can come only from that which is good. But if you ungrateful people cheat me out of my well earned pay then you will come to know the evil powers as well. Thus take heed of my final word. In your city there is a recess in the wall of the house not far from the church and at its right side. Place the payment we agreed upon there before the next dawn. If you fail to do so, I will find my own reward. "" He departed, followed by the loud and derisive laughter of the councilmen. It should come as no surprise that the next morning there was no money lying in the niche. With the sun's first rays Korneuburg experienced its own drama. Hans Mousehole, dressed in a purple-red robe and playing a golden flute, stood at the marketplace in front of the town hall. The melodious tunes that he evoked from his instrument must have sounded like music from heaven to the children, for they gathered about the mysterious musician with joyful haste. Still playing, he walked toward the Danube, where a large and handsome ship awaited him. Led by the flute player, the procession boarded the ship. Its sails billowed, and it floated out to the middle of the stream. This time the ratcatcher did not return. To the contrary, the ship sailed further and further from the city, and neither it nor any who were aboard were ever seen there again. Many years later the horrified citizens of Korneuburg received news that in that same year a large number of children had been placed up for sale in the slave markets of Constantinople. They had no doubt that the children were theirs, and they rued their lack of honor, but too late. History has recorded that Korneuburg was freed of rats at the time stated above and by a ratcatcher from Vienna in the manner described. Until not long ago there was a small rectangular marble plaque on a house in Pfarrgäßchen Street.

She and her attendants were terrified at this overly rich blessing, and they feared the worst from their count and lord, for he was temperamental and had often spoken unfavorably about women who had given birth to more than one child -- say two or three at one time -- and here there were fully three times three.

Arthur very much lamented the damsel's sad fate, and ordered his companions to leave him to deal with him alone; unless there was an absolute necessity, and then they were to come in boldly to his assistance. From hence they went directly to the next mountain, leaving their horses with their armour-bearers, and ascended to the top, Arthur leading the way. The deformed savage was then by the fire, with his face besmeared with the clotted blood of swine, part of which he had already devoured, and was roasting the remainder upon spits by the fire. But at the sight of them, whose appearance was a surprise to him, he hastened to his club, which two strong men could hardly lift from the ground. Upon this the king drew his sword, and guarding himself with his shield, ran with all his speed to keep him from getting it. But the other, who was not ignorant of his design, had by this time snatched it up, and gave the king such a terrible blow upon his shield, that he made the shores ring with the noise, and perfectly stunned the king's ears with it. Arthur, fired with rage at this, lifted up his sword, and gave him a wound in the forehead, which was not indeed mortal, but yet such as made the blood gush out over his face and eyes, and so blinded him; for he had partly warded off the stroke from his forehead with his club, and prevented its being fatal. However, his loss of sight, by reason of the blood flowing over his eyes, made him exert himself with greater fury, and like an enraged boar against a hunting-spear, so did he rush in against Arthur's sword, and grasping him about the waist, forced him down upon his knees. But Arthur, nothing daunted, slipped out of his hands, and so bestirred himself with his sword, that he gave the giant no respite till he had struck it up to the very back through his skull. At this the hideous monster raised a dreadful roar, and like an oak torn up from the roots by the winds, so did he make the ground resound with his fall. Arthur, bursting out into a fit of laughter at the sight, commanded Bedver to cut off his head, and give it to one of the armour-bearers, who was to carry it to the camp, and there expose it to public view, but with orders for the spectators of this combat to keep silence. After this victory, they returned at the second watch of the night to the camp with the head; to see which there was a great concourse of people, all extolling this wonderful exploit of Arthur, by which he had freed the country from a most destructive and voracious monster.

So the queen of the fairies gave to the chief a wonderful flag which possessed the quality of granting them three wishes, but only in time of great need. The flag was carefully laid away and not brought out for a long while. At last there was great woe at Dunvegan, the castle of the MacLeods, for the heir was lost. Then someone thought of the flag and it was used, and soon after the boy was found. A second time it was used to save the chief from death, and carefully laid away again, but, alas, so carefully that it could not be found till, in 1799, an iron chest that seemed keyless was broken open and found to contain an inner case in which was a scented casket, in that the fairy flag. Now, before the finding of the flag a seer had predicted that when the third Norman son of an English lady should perish accidentally, the ""Maidens"" (three large rocks in the ocean belonging to MacLeod) should be sold to the Campbells; a fox should litter in the castle; and the fairy flag be found. The glory of the MacLeods would then depart, but to be more than recovered in the future when another chief called Ian Breac should arise. In 1799 all these things happened, but at the present time the heir presumptive is called Ian Breac, so it is to be hoped that the glory of the MacLeod's will return.

Caught by a sudden need for money, he thought of a wealthy Jew, Melchizedek by name, who lived in Alexandria. But Melchizedek had a reputation for miserliness, and he would never voluntarily surrender the vast sum needed by Saladin, nor was the Sultan prepared to take the money by force. At last Saladin devised a plan whereby he would embarrass the wealthy Jew, who would then redeem himself with money. Accordingly, Saladin summoned Melchizedek to his palace, then stated, ""Men speak highly of your wisdom. What conclusion have you reached concerning the ways of God? Which of the three great religions is the truly authentic one? Judaism, Christianity, or Islam?""

Tradition says that the foundress spent all her money on these almshouses, and that she became in consequence so poor that she had to occupy one herself. That is why there is in the centre of the building a figure of a man, very quaint and rudely carved, holding an axe in his hand with these lines beneath: He that gives away all before he is dead, Let 'em take this hatchet and knock him on ye head. The inscription on a stone on the front of the building contradicts the tradition, for it expressly states: ""This Hospital was erected by Hester Clark and endowed at her death with 20 pounds per annum, to four decayed widows. "" This is a good example of the way in which a rhyme and folk-tale of great antiquity are as it were brought up to date and started on a new lease of life by being associated with some local hero or person of note ( see ante, Jack o' Kent ). Sir Laurence Gomme ( Folklore as an Historical Science , 66-78), has collected a number of parallel stories to this. He concludes that the tale has come down to us from a savage time when the mallet (in this case a hatchet) was actually used for killing off the aged. At Osnabrück, in front of a house (but sometimes at the city gate, as in several of the cities of Silesia and Saxony), there hangs a mallet with this inscription: Wer den kindern gibt das Brodt And selber dabei leidet Noth, Den schlagt mit dieser Kettle todt. Which Mr. Thoms has Englished thus: Who to his children gives his bread And thereby himself suffers need, With this mallet strike him dead. ( Gentleman's Magazine , 1850, 250-2) Sir Laurence Gomme concludes that life of the folk-tale commenced when the use or formula of the mallet ceased to be a part of the social institutions. The old customs which we have detailed as the true origin of the mallet ceased to exist. Instead, a new myth was created, which saw the old godhead's honor soar into a majestic sky-rocket. The story ran that a lonely farmwife, who in her dowry had lost all her property, went to her kinsmen and declared her reliance on them. After some time the thieves entered, and owing to a quantity of treasure found, were granted entrance to the vault. The lord of the mansion, perceiving that something was wrong, hastened to his wife and deputed a servant to inquire if everything was in order.

And the magistrate who passed sentence upon him, ordered him to be shut up in prison for three years, with all his possessions, and thus closed the book that bore the fair lady's name. But a serpent, who, under the same magistrate, became a monk. While he was in prison, he hid himself in the cell with his master's bowl of porridge, and a Bible in his hand. When the three years were nearly finished, the knight broke his penknife in three places, and lay down to sleep. But the serpent, being able to do this, called out: ""Is this the way I'm going to be rewarded? If I can just take this bowl of porridge from the plate, it will make a great start towards my happiness!"" So the serpent took the porridge and went off with it. When the three years were nearly finished, the knight got up and ate the porridge. When he tried to put it down, the bowl fell to the ground and he had to beg for it. The devil got hold of the porridge, ate it, and returned to his master in heaven.

Nevertheless, the master was so angry that he cursed the snake, calling him every day, ""Sir Knight, I curse you, I curse you!"" But the devil just sat there, and said, ""How can I be punished?

He said, ""Mother, I can eat only so much, but I know that I must take more than that. "" So he took a knife and cut off one of his fingers, and put it in his mouth. Then he said, ""Mother, I am starving. Do you have any broth for me?"" And he kept on eating, and every time that he ate, more of his finger grew out of his mouth. So his mother began to get very desperate, went to her son, and said, ""Son, tell me immediately what you are going to do with your finger, and I will get a slave to teach you how to raise children. "" The son did what his father asked, and every day from morning until evening he would tell his master the news. The master was not satisfied with what his son said, and wanted to know how he could become so rich, for his daughter was already rich. So he had the son stand in front of his house and keep watch from morning until evening. When the evening came, his master went out and began to drink, and his wife and daughter remained in the house. And when evening came again, the son went out and found a slave girl ready to marry him. So he called out, ""My little wife! My little wife!"" But the slave said, ""Don't call me that. I am too strong for you. You are a burden to me. You should know that I have a great fear of men who are called Doctor. "" So he ran home and told his wife what had happened.

Afterward he took her to the brook where he had met the snake, and he led her to the thorn tree where he had laid her, and he prayed that the snake would take her away with him. But the snake refused to go, because she had eloped with a strange man. Then Peter called a little servant girl to him, and told her to tell the snake to carry the princess away. The girl went to the snake and did what she had been asked, and then the snake carried the princess away. Then Peter commanded the girl to return home, because he needed some things from her.

The servant, through some means, collected all the crows into the barn, and shut the door on them. He then followed his master to the church, who, when he saw the servant there, began to reprove him sharply. But the master, when he heard the strange news, turned his steps homewards, and found to his amazement that the tale was true, and it is said that the barn was filled with crows.

samples-56400,"The Trolls Celebrate Christmas Of the manner in which the trolls celebrate Christmas Eve there are traditions throughout the whole North. At that time it is not advisable for Christian men to be out. On the heaths witches and little trolls ride, one on a wolf, another on a broom or a shovel, to their assemblies, where they dance under their stones. These stones are then raised on pillars, under which the trolls dance and drink. In the mount are then to be heard mirth and music, dancing and drinking. On Christmas morn, during the time between cock-crowing and daybreak, it is highly dangerous to be abroad. One Christmas night in the year 1490, as Fru Cissela Ulftand was sitting in her mansion at Liungby in Scania, a great noise was heard proceeding from the trolls assembled at the Magle stone, when one of the lady's boldest servants rode out to see what was going on. He found the stone raised, and the trolls in a noisy whirl dancing under it. A beautiful female stepped forth, and presented to the guest a drinking horn and a pipe, requesting him to drink the troll-king's health and to blow in the pipe. He took the horn and pipe, but at the same instant clapped spurs to his horse, and galloped straight, over rough and smooth, to the mansion. The trolls followed him in a body with a wild cry of threats and prayers, but the man kept the start, and delivered both horn and pipe into the hands of his mistress. The trolls promised prosperity and riches to Fru Cissela's race, if she would restore their pipe and horn; but she persisted in keeping them, and they are still preserved at Liungby, as memorials of the wonderful event. The horn is said to be of an unknown mixture of metals with brass ornaments, and the pipe of a horse's leg-bone. The man who stole them from the trolls died three days after, and the horse on the second day. Liungby mansion has been twice burnt, and the Ulftand family never prospered afterwards. This tradition teaches that Christians should act justly even towards trolls. It is also related of some priests, who were riding before daybreak by a mount on a Christmas morning, while the trolls were at their sports, how suddenly a ""high wind"" child cried, ""If some one is picking the milk, let him be quick. "" Just as the priest was returning with the rest of the family to theisch, they met a rider, who presented himself on the opposite side of the mount. They thought he was a large fellow, but when he began to pass over the top of them, they fell upon him and slew him. They then began to eat the remains of him. They thought they would be able to come back in time to the world. The priest came again at the end of a year, and they made the same demand, for the child's bones were still lying warm on the bone table.

And, indeed, he had such power of returning to Synefs as to bring back the lost Jew.

"" He was born in the year 1500, and followed the employment of fishing for one hundred and forty years. When about eleven or twelve years old, he was sent to Northallerton with a horse-load of arrows for the army of the Earl of Surrey, on its march to the north, all the men being then employed at harvest. When he was more than one hundred years old, he used to swim and wade across the river with the utmost ease, and without catching cold. What is the most remarkable, he retained his sight to the last, having made without spectacles two artificial flies for fishing the year before he died; his hearing also continued till his death. Being summoned to give evidence in a tithe cause in 1667, between Charles Anthony, Vicar of Catterick, and Calvert Smithson, owner and occupier of lands in Kipling, he deposed, ""That the tithes of wool, lamb, &c. , mentioned in the interrogatories, were the vicar's, and had been paid to his knowledge six score years and more. "" And in another cause at York, between John Grubham Howe, Esq. , and Mrs. Wastell of Eilerton, about the royalty of the river Swale, he gave evidence to one hundred and forty years. Previous to Jenkins's going to York, when the agent of Mrs. Wastell went to him, to find out what account he could give about the matter in dispute, he saw an old man sitting at the door, to whom he told his business. The old man said, ""He could remember nothing about it, but that he would find his father in the house, who perhaps could satisfy him. "" When he went in he saw another old man sitting over the fire, bowed down with years, to whom he repeated his former question. With some difficulty he made him understand what he had said; and after a little time got the following answer which surprised him very much, ""That he knew nothing about it, but that if he would go into the yard, he would meet with his father, who perhaps could tell him. "" The agent upon this thought that he had met with a race of antediluvians. However into the yard he went, and to his no small astonish ment found a venerable old man, with a long beard and a broad leathern belt about him, chopping sticks. To this man he again told his business and received such information as in the end recovered the royalty in dispute. As this was a singular piece of service to Mrs. Wastell's cause, which without this man's evidence must have been given to her antagonist, some little annuity might have been settled upon him; but so far from it, that in his old age he went about asking charity and lived the remainder of his life upon very coarse diet.",0.5239347824114832,0.6239347824114831,-0.1,0.0

She promised that on three distinct occasions when he or his clan were in danger, he might wave the flag with certainty of relief. MacLeod proved false to his fairy, and married a mere commonplace human maiden, whereupon his spirit wife waxed wroth, and ordained that every woman in the clan should give birth to a dead child, and that all the cattle should have dead calves. Then a loud and bitter wail rang through the green valleys, and along the shores, and MacLeod, in sore tribulation, bethought him of the flag. The fairy proved more true to her words than her lover had been to his, so she withdrew her spell, and the clan once more flourished. Then came a terrible battle, when MacLeod and his men were well-nigh routed, and again, though he must have been sorely ashamed of himself, he waved the flag, and the victory was his. Why the flag was not waved for the third time, when the isles were ruined by the failure of the kelp trade, or during the potato famine, MacLeod best knows. Perhaps he thought it well to save one ""last tune in the old fiddle.

The flag was carefully laid away and not brought out for a long while. At last there was great woe at Dunvegan, the castle of the MacLeods, for the heir was lost. Then someone thought of the flag and it was used, and soon after the boy was found.

But it happened within a little while that they were all weary of him, after that they had got what they had, and regarded him no more than a dog. The old man perceiving how he was slighted, went to an attorney to see if his skill could not afford him any help in his troubles. The attorney told him that no law in the land could help him nor yield him any comfort, but there was one thing only which would certainly do, which, if he would perform, he would reveal to him. At this the poor old man was exceeding glad, and desired him for God's sake to reveal the same, for he was almost pined and starved to death, and he would willingly do it rather than live as he did. ""Well,"" says the lawyer, ""you have been a great friend of mine in my need, and I will now be one to you in your need. I will lend you a strongbox with a strong lock on it, in which shall be contained 1000 pounds. You shall on such a day pretend to have fetched it out of a closet, where it shall be supposed that you had hidden it, and carry it into one of your son's houses, and make it your business every week, while you are sojourning with such or such a son, to be always counting of the money, and rattling it about, and you shall see that, for love of it, they'll soon love you again, and make very much of you, and maintain you joyfully, willingly, and plentifully, unto your dying day. "" The old man, having thanked the lawyer for this good advice and kind proffer, received within a few days the aforesaid box full of money, and having so managed it as above, his graceless sons soon fell in love with him again, and made mighty much of him, and perceiving that their love to him continued steadfast and firm, he one day took it out of the house and carried it to the lawyer, thanking him exceedingly for the loan thereof. But when he got to his sons he made them believe that he had hidden it again, and that he would give it to him of them whom he loved best when he died. This made them all so observant of him that he lived the rest of his days in great peace, plenty, and happiness amongst them, and died full of years. But a while before he died, he upbraided them for their former ingratitude, told them the whole history of the box, and forgave them.",0.6075398083560299,0.7075398083560299,-0.1,0.0

Freely given, they repaired there, and found a ready midden, or common, field; for they were the first who saw the tower, and it was immediately ordered that the ladder should be made ready for them. They at once went into the tower, and the ladder commenced to make its way upwards, but when they had made it, and the door was at last open, they found nothing but a large and luminous stone which shone with a clear blue light. The two swans which had accompanied the ladder appeared, and took each a little end of the light in their beak, and flew away with the light in their beak.

The legend of the Swan Maiden is, therefore, a good guide in choice of the modern story of the ""Good People,"" of the fairy flag or flagstone. The legend of the Swan Maiden starts, as most traditions of this kind usually do, on the Hesperides, who seem to have been the first spirits ever recorded as dwelling at Vulcan's Mountain. The legend says that there lived there a man who had been at several times before in different places, and had often sought its destruction. When he first saw it, he was tempted to sink it into the water; but, being afraid of falling into it, he held it up to the light, and threw it off, and hastened on, his intention being made clear to him. But the serpent, watching his every move, pounced on him at once, and held him tightly, both of his arms, and of his legs, and pressed so hard on him that he felt the blood gush out over his face, and eyes, and ears, and nose, and everything was so painful that he felt the short-coming of his delight. Poor Melusina, who had been so cruelly treated by the serpent, was surprised at the sight of the friendly spirit, and her own joy roused her bestial lusts. She was in the utmost distress, and required aid. The friendly spirit appeared to her and offered to do her service for her; and, as a remembrance of the kindness of the spirit, she was to be supplied with every comfort, and upbringing was to be applied to her from a mother's arms. So the mother, who had been unconsciously buried in the earth, peered up and saw the serpent, which, taking hold of her pig, soared through the earth and disappeared.",0.6361196553415353,0.7361196553415352,-0.1,0.0

If the rogues knew how many people there were in the house that they wanted to rob, then they would ignite that number of lights, and no one would be able to wake up as long as the lights were burning. These lights were made from unborn children which had been cut from the womb. Therefore it occurred not infrequently that pregnant women were sold to bandits for high prices. That very thing happened once at a mill. A servant girl who was pregnant worked for the miller. Her fiancé came to visit her one night. He saw a wagon standing before the door of the miller's house. It was covered with a tarp. He heard a stifled groaning sound coming from beneath the tarp. The servant rushed to the living-room window, and inside he saw several fellows with the miller. They were counting out a large pile of silver coins onto the table. The servant immediately became suspicious and rushed back to investigate the wagon. He pulled his own fiancée from beneath the wagon tarp. Her mouth had been bound with a cloth. The servant carried her to safety and then untied her hands and feet. The robbers soon emerged from the house and drove off as fast as their horses could run, thinking that they were carrying with them a rich booty. Narrative 2 Once a rogue slipped into a house during the day. The inhabitants of the house saw him, but although they searched high and low, they could not find him. At nightfall the inhabitants went to bed, but the servant girl could not fall asleep. She was afraid of the stranger, and wanted to look around carefully one last time. To her fright she discovered him hiding in the stove. The girl then pretended to fall asleep. Now that all was quiet in the house, the rogue climbed out of the stove and ignited as many lights as there were people in the house. But one of the lights would not burn. He believed that the girl was not yet asleep and held a burning light against her feet. However, in her fear she withstood the pain and did not move. Now satisfied, the rogue placed all the lights on the table and went outside to summon his fellow robbers. The girl jumped up and barred the door shut behind him. She attempted to awaken the people in the house, but to no avail. She then tried to extinguish the lights, but failed to do this as well.

After mutual salutation, the old man gave Sir Godfrey to understand, that he resided under his habitation, and that he had great reason to complain of the direction of a drain, or common sewer, which emptied itself directly into his chamber of dais. * Sir Godfrey Macculloch was a good deal startled at this extraordinary complaint; but, guessing the nature of the being he had to deal with, he assured the old man, with great courtesy, that the direction of the drain should be altered; and caused it to be done accordingly. Many years afterwards, Sir Godfrey had the misfortune to kill, in a fray, a gentleman of the neighborhood. He was apprehended, tried, and condemned. † The scaffold, upon which his head",0.7231263803208289,0.7231263803208289,0.0,0.0

Thomas of Erceldoune, during his retirement, has been supposed, from time to time, to be levying forces to take the field in some crisis of his country's fate. The story has often been told, of a daring horse-jockey having sold a black horse to a man of venerable and antique appearance, who appointed the remarkable hillock upon Eildon hills, called the Lucken-hare, as the place where, at twelve o'clock, he should receive the price. He came, his money was paid in ancient coin, and he was invited by his customer to view his residence. The trader in horses followed his guide in the deepest astonishment through several long ranges of stalls, in each of which a horse stood motionless, while an armed warrior lay equally still at the charger's feet. ""All these men,"" said the wizard, in a whisper, ""will awaken at the battle of Sheriffmoor. "" At the extremity of this extraordinary depot hung a sword and a horn, which the prophet pointed out to the horse-dealer as containing the means of dissolving the spell. The man in confusion took the horn, and attempted to wind it. The horses instantly started in their stalls, stamped, and shook their bridles, the men arose and clashed their armour, and the mortal, terrified at the tumult he had excited, dropped the horn from his hand. A voice like that of a giant, louder even than the tumult around, pronounced these words: Woe to the coward that ever he was born, That did not draw the sword before he blew it. A whirlwind expelled the horse-dealer from the cavern, the entrance to which he could never again find. A moral might be perhaps extracted from the legend, namely, that it is best to be armed against danger before bidding it defiance.",0.7215980625489168,0.7215980625489168,0.0,0.0

A smith who lived in the island heard the report, and resolved that he would attempt to enter the rock. He reached the place where it was; and, having formed a good idea of the keyhole, he returned to the smithy, and made a key which fitted the hole. He then went back to the rock, and, as soon as he turned the key in the hole, the door opened, and he saw a very great and wide place before him, and exceedingly big men lying on the floor. One man, bigger than the rest, was lying in their midst, having a large hollow baton of wood lying beside him. He thought that this was the wooden crier (whistle), but it was so large that he was afraid that he could not lift it, much less blow it. He stood for a time looking at it, but he at last said to himself that, as he came so far, he would try at any rate. He laid hold of the wooden crier, and with difficulty raised its end up to his mouth. He blew it with all his might, and so loud was the sound it produced that he thought the rock and all that was over it came down on the top of him. The huge unwieldy men who lay on the floor shook from the tops of their heads to the soles of their feet. He gave another blast on the wooden crier, and with one spring they turned on their elbows. Their fingers were like the prongs of wooden grapes [large forks used in sea harvesting], and their arms like beams of bog oak. Their size and the terrible appearance they had put him in such fear that he threw the wooden crier from him, and sprang out. They were then crying after him, ""Worse have you left us than as you found us. "" But he looked not behind him until he got outside and shut the door. He then drew the key out of the hole, and threw it out into the lake which is near the rock, and which is called to this day the Lake of the Smith's Rock.",0.6098878060265965,0.7098878060265965,-0.1,0.0

samples-5600,"A Neat Summary of Baldess von Staufenberg Catallactics possess a splendid treasure buried deep in the ground -- a large, heavy stone tablet recorded in detail by the angel who guided Saint Peter to the sacred castle. The stone tablet, upon which were engraved many prayers and verses, was found in a vault beneath the castle. It is called the Will-o'-the-Wisp. By means of an inscription, it was possible, during the night, to render powerless the will-o'-the-wisp that formerly occupied the same room. The following legend is current among the catallactics: A man put a will-o'-the-wisp in the bedroom of a man, where he resided, in order to compel him to produce his child. The will-o'-the-wisp would give its master a blow with a paddle if the demands were not made immediately apparent. The master did not want to do this, but the will-o'-the-wisp insisted. Finally, after much coaxing, he gave his reasons for resistance, and the will-o'-the-wisp left in its stead a younger and more promising dwarf. The latter, upon his arrival, made his first request -- that his lord should place him in his father's will. The master gave him the required blessing and then commanded him to open the window of the lodge so that he could see outside. Obtaining permission from the lord's chaplain, the demi-goddess obtained for herself a lofty and lofty tomb, wherein she might dwell eternally in peace. She was nearly an hundred years old. Saint Peter soon succeeded in finding his way into the great tomb, and when, after three revolutions, it was finally able to re-establish its upright position, the knight was mournfully besought to come and easily solve the mystery. He was given a sound thrashing, and the horrible stone was cast down and disappeared beneath the waters. A few years afterward, about Christmastime, the knight was once again summoned to come to the tomb. This time the knight had not been stingy with the lindorm, nor was he dull with the will-o'-the-wisp, but he was cunning enough to allow the serpent to place its nest immediately beneath the knight's feet. Now, the will-o'-the-wisp is a very curious being. It lives in the chamber of elders, and in great herds, and in places where there are no larger animals. It is silent and solitary, but it has the faculty of appearing in the form of any creature that it sees. In the shape of a toad, it has so beguiled the knight that he has not dared to hunt the beast without being bitten by it. The young toads, when they are fried, remain on the shell, and the knight has borne its venomous image on his body for so long a time that it has lost its natural luster. The toad has put forth its own shell, and across the place where the original had been cut off. Now, the knight has borne this alter ego so long that he is almost blind with old age, and the toad has taken advantage of this circumstances and laid itself at his feet to feed on his fat, flitting about to get at his fat. As the story teaches, the knight had better things to do than take notice of a lazy sloth scolding his dog. So he turns up, with a drawn sword in his hand, and storms down into the inner chamber. The toad, seeing the danger, and finding himself surrounded by enemies, issues from his nest and takes flight. But Habel, a old mouse-deer, is not to be trifled with. He grows bolder and stronger, and as the story goes, senses the presence of some mysterious being watching him, so he grows larger and larger, until he is about the same size as an oven mitt. At this moment the knight turns his face towards the direction in which he had been led, and calls out, ""Brothers! What are you looking for?"" The elves, seeing the knight in danger, rush forwards with gladness to aid him, and lend a hand with some that are about them in the utmost joy and ease. The knight himself, with a sigh, gives his coat to one of them, and says to the others, ""Take care not to cry; I am protected by God, and in my breast by my inner garment. "" Then bidding the elves take care not to step on his feet either, he puts his sword in its sheath and leaves it there for the moment. As soon as he is secure in his place, he asks the one who has the golden mill to make ready some horses' feet for him. While he is getting ready the same kind of foot comes from the horse's feet, and he recognises the smell",0.7527235127038236,0.7527235127038236,0.0,0.0

His place was too dangerous; but a poor bard lived there who was very poor. Every day when the cat came to feed there was always a great demand for mice from the neighboring cities. The townsmen beat and scolded him, but he said not a word. He was afraid to throw away a few crumbs, and he wanted to say something to the townsmen.

The beast howled terribly, and then went into the underground world. The next morning the apprentice entered the spinning room, but could not find the cat. The girl had fired a shot at the cat, and the unaccountable event had taken place. The underground people brought the body back to the spinning room. The apprentice sitting there upon the bench could not believe the event, and asked the girl to tell him what had happened. She told him everything, and the dwarf's child was dead. He then asked her if she had seen a strange man carrying a kettle by the footpath. She told him everything, and he had three days to decide whether to take the bet, or not. He took the bet, and his money was paid in full. He then opened the book and read the text in it.

This avaricious woman regularly spent all her time preparing a feast for various sumptuousures, but never once considered how her appetite might be frustrated. Indeed, she so disregarded the secret that she bewitched one of her neighbors, who in the course of the evening was obliged to attend at the Puck's plate. As soon as he arrived, the Puck said to him, ""You must be hungry. I have not fed you. "" ""No,"" said the man. ""The truth is, I was starved.

Here, then, she was, in the fog, at an ease such as she had not known prior to her escape. But on the tortoise's return, the man said to him, ""You saw my neighbor fain to eat of my good food, and you ran away, not giving it utterance. "" ""Oh, for that I have done,"" said the tortoise.

""My ancestors told me that the people who are now being exterminated had once been very rich and powerful, and that this is what they want to restore.

The conditions of the proposition were: that from a strength of five to seven hundred million Germans would be necessary to ensure the success of the plan; that the Allies would have to include among their forces one hundred and twenty one thousand five hundred men; and that the plan should be carried out without the intervention of the enemy.

The dance went on for all manner of enchantments, and the king of the hills seemed to be everywhere seen, with his crown and wen on display. A splendid cocqueori (horn-coven) was also erected in the neighborhood, and the young people who could not manage to get onto it were condemned to travel more intimately with the king of the hills, who often led them among his people, discussing with them philosophy and all the strange arts. They also witnessed the burying of the former marriage feast, in which the young bride and the she-devil , in separate cups, enjoyed the luxury of the devil. These charming times were indeed hell, for the young people were scant and weak, and tended more than any other group to abandon ship and seek their fortunes abroad. There are various versions of the origin of this curious legend, and I will not detain the students by my own explanation, which I made much over a century and a half ago. A direct cause of this lamentation was the known fact that Helena, the current queen of the kingdom, was unmarried, and there was serious discord between the two sisters, who did not like each other. This amiable state of affairs probably resulted from the devil's having deceived the first sister, who had desire to marry the king's son. She was induced to marry the devil, and when the devil carried off the one wife, he caused the devil to carry off the second one, whereupon the second wife was possessed of great wisdom and became the queen of all the demons. She combed her hair into a bushy tail, sewed it up, and so appeared at the head of the prince and spoke to him, asking him what to do with her. He told her to chain her up the tree and to drive nails through her to prevent her escaping. If at the first attempt she made it impossible for him to drive the nails through, he locked her up in the cell with her head under the water and drowned her. She came out hating land and loving hell, and she must have resented her fate, for if the devil had not hindered her, she might have gone to prison. Yet it is said that the devil gained something from her, for when she was already in league with him, he did not spare her when she became pregnant. Thus she did not repent, and before the beginning of the next cycle of her life she did not know it. The cycle lasted for seven years, and",0.25987565371037946,0.7598756537103795,-0.5,0.0

Everything was to be carried off with the greatest speed, not only on festival days, but on all other days under heaven and earth. The most sacred and beautiful treasures were to be left in their proper places in the palace and the city. This was the state and custom of the Romans; but there were a considerable number of them who desired more of the common law and their own customs. They had, therefore, a certain number of knights who were not of this kind, and who had their houses all set out neatly painted with red, blue, green, and white, so that a hundred windows appeared in each house; that one window being particularly decorated for the most valuable and valuable things. They had likewise houses which were quite ornamented in every particular, and were not only richly adorned, but perfectly furnished with all manner of costly furniture. As soon, therefore, as any of these persons were in possession of any treasure, they would seize all that was in it in their own houses, place it in a ring in their fingers, and carry it into a certain place in the town. This was the general practice of the country people. One day a certain person being accused, confessed in the presence of several judges, who said he was innocent, and that he could not give the reason why he had taken the treasure, and kept it with him. The judge then demanded the name of the said person, who told him he was the same who had taken the treasure; and he desired him to make that name known to him, or he would kill him. The man had neither words nor money enough to proceed beyond what he had done, therefore he took the treasure to a certain well, and when it was full he went home, leaving the treasure in the ring in his hand, and, with it, in the same ring.

However, he did not die for several years afterwards; and miserable years many of them were. Besides the weariness of old age, the old fellow had to bear with much abuse and cruelty from his sons. Wretched, selfish ingrates! Previously they vied with one another in trying to please their father, hoping thus to receive more money, but now they had received their patrimony, they cared not how soon he left them -- nay, the sooner the better, because he was only a poor little beast like they were. This, as we may suppose, was a great grief to the old man. One day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles. The friend sympathized very much with him, and promised to think over the matter, and call in a little while and tell him what to do. He did so; in a few days he visited the old man and put down four bags full of stones and gravel before him. ""Look here, friend,"" said he. ""Your sons will get to know of my coming here today, and will inquire about it. You must pretend that I came to discharge a long-standing debt with you, and that you are several thousands of rupees richer than you thought you were. Keep these bags in your own hands, and on no account let your son get to them as long as you are alive. You will soon find your children spending more time with you and living with you and believing in you than they did before. "" The young man listened to his friend's story and made the necessary preparations to go to his father's house. He invited his sons to the wedding and other functions; and all the while the elder son looked on all fours and kept constantly shouting ""I'll be a better man than you!"" The young man took these words for gospel and began to work day and night. He walked home with his wife, who was as noisy as a drum. They arrived at the house, and the young wife stood at the door knitting and mending her skirt. The trolls came in on the horse-door step, and the man received them with the greatest of humility, saying that he could not dissuade them from that way of thinking.

The young man's father, observing the miserly state of the old man, decided to rob him. Knowing that he would be successful, he hid himself among the branches of a willow tree. The willow tree is popular with wet nurses, as it is said that they can gain their children's trust by lying to them and pretending to be very poor. The father therefore resolved to stay up and keep watch on the first man who came with his children. He did this, and as he was standing at the door he heard a little man come toward him. The father did not know who he was, but thought he would be able to deal with him later, when he had something to eat. The little man begged for a bite of bread, but the father refused it, asking for a bite of meat instead. The little man then begged for a pinch of salt, and the father told him that he had only to say the word ""salvation"" and the poor man would instantly be transformed into a stream of pure gold. The good son had to take the tongs and cut the bread into small pieces. When the son had left the house, the father went to the little man and tried to transform him into a human, but the little man scolded him severely, saying, ""Do you think me worth your time?""

Arthur very much lamented the damsel's sad fate, and ordered his companions to leave him to deal with him alone; unless there was an absolute necessity, and then they were to come in boldly to his assistance. From hence they went directly to the next mountain, leaving their horses with their armour-bearers, and ascended to the top, Arthur leading the way. The deformed savage was then by the fire, with his face besmeared with the clotted blood of swine, part of which he had already devoured, and was roasting the remainder upon spits by the fire.

Upon this the king drew his sword, and guarding himself with his shield, ran with all his speed to prevent his getting it. But the other, who was not ignorant of his design, had by this time snatched it up, and gave the king such a terrible blow upon his shield, that he made the shores ring with the noise, and perfectly stunned the king's ears with it. Arthur, fired with rage at this, lifted up his sword, and gave him a wound in the forehead, which was not indeed mortal, but yet such as made the blood gush out over his face and eyes, and so blinded him; for he had partly warded off the stroke from his forehead with his club, and prevented its being fatal. However, his loss of sight, by reason of the blood flowing over his eyes, made him exert himself with greater fury, and like an enraged boar against a hunting-spear, so did he rush in against Arthur's sword, and grasping him about the waist, forced him down upon his knees. But Arthur, nothing daunted, slipped out of his hands, and so bestirred himself with his sword, that he gave the giant no respite till he had struck it up to the very back through his skull. At this the hideous monster raised a dreadful roar, and like an oak torn up from the roots by the winds, so did he make the ground resound with his fall.

After this victory, they returned at the second watch of the night to the camp with the head; to see which there was a great concourse of people, all extolling this wonderful exploit of Arthur, by which he had freed the country from a most destructive and voracious monster.

""There are two eyes too many in here!"" he said again, but when the woman began to make fun of him, he filled the pots and disappeared up the chimney. At noon when everyone was seated at the table, the servant said, ""I don't want to eat, because I know that it came from the devil!""

Her charms, spells, and dark incantations made her the terror of the neighborhood. However, this old lady failed to impress her husband with any belief in her supernatural powers, nor did he fail to proclaim his unbelief aloud. One day this skeptic came home to dinner, and found, being exceedingly hungry, to his bitter disappointment, that not only was there no dinner to eat, but that there was no meat in the house. His rage was great, but all he could get from his wife was, ""I couldn't get meat out of the stones, could I?"" It was in vain to give the reins to passion, the old woman told him, and he must know ""that hard words buttered no parsnips. "" Well, at length he resolved to put his wife's powers to the proof, and he quietly but determinedly told her that he would be the death of her if she did not get him some dinner; but if in half an hour she gave him some good cooked meat, he would believe all she had boasted of her power, and be submissive to her forever.

His favorite beverage is drink, and he will often ro find a good hole to lie in the bog after he has dug a hole for himself. Worcestershire pudding The following story is told in all parts of Scotland in the mode described above: A farmer had a pudding which seemed to be following him until he came to a bog. ""Dear me!"" said he, ""am I about to go to the bog forever and ever?"" The pudding said, ""No, you are not. "" And continued on its way, popping up finally at a table. The farmer said, ""Puddings, I've found you!"" ""That is true,"" said the pudding. ""But I was always afraid of going to the bog, for one time I was good and came home again!"" The farmer said, ""Don't be afraid, and take care. I will come by myself, and then you may just go to the table. "" The pudding consented, and went by himself to the table. The drunkard was just about to eat when he heard a voice call out, ""Let us be married!"" At first he was alarmed, but soon he sees the face of his fiancée, whom he had never seen before. Then he learns that she has been the cause of all this trouble, and he makes her go away. Then the fiancée said to him, ""Let us go and market ourselves in the best way. "" And they did so. From time to time they ate and drank and made merry. But soon they were up past their marks, and home went not more than three or four people at a time. Once they were willing enough to go to the king, and they begged him to select for them a bride from among their number. He gave them permission, and the Pixy Bride was born.",0.23791705680285843,0.7379170568028585,-0.4,-0.1

""If you will go faster,"" said she, ""I will go half as fast as you. "" The hare complied, and while the tortoise ran slowly, she stretched out her tail and swept the ground at the same time, leaving the tortoise speechless. The advantage was soon exhausted; but still the hare was nowhere near the finish line, and it was late when she stopped to catch her breath. The tortoise was so outraged at his loss of time and of the victory that he flung the fox out of his skin. The latter, however, continued him on the spot, and after a night's rest he could now vie with the others in the hunt. The hare came again the next day, but this time she was so badly burned that she could not go. The judges decided that the tortoise had been the serious runner, and paid him only a little cold shoulder.

""Sir,"" said she, ""for a muff, for your company, and the use of both, I have a whole budget of tricks to come off with at last. "" ""Why, first, my blowing war-whale, and then you shall see what I shall do to you when I think fit!"" And with that she bag'd up her bag and took it home to her old chum. The next day the twelfth man showed up, and, delighted with his beautiful appearance, agreed to reveal the secret. ""Well,"" says the jester, ""you have been a great friend of mine in my need, and I will now be one to you in your need. I will lend you a strongbox with a strong lock on it, in which shall be contained 1000 pounds. You shall on such a day pretend to have fetched it out of a closet, where it shall be supposed that you had hidden it, and carry it into one of your son's houses, and make it your business to secretly watch, while it shall be said that you had met with an old lady of the neighbourhood, and she had been accosted by an old monk, and begged of her to allow him to dress himself as a monk, but would she allow him to carry her little child, dressed as a monk, with him into the church, where the old woman would not suspicionlessly recognize him, and after dinner he would immediately depart, carrying the little loaded animal with him. Well, at length the wish came true, and the old woman, thinking herself secure, received Herself in the form of a lowly maid, and went home. Well, she thought she would search for the little on Thursday, so she went to Llanidloes and told the case to the forester, who was to see if he could not help her. Now, early in the morning the case was worked out. The fox got the stick across the bridge and the cat got it up. The cat was quite satisfied with that, but the fox said that he wanted the whole box. The lion was the first to see this, and he said, ""You have only got it up hill,"" and so the case was decided in his favor. The lion was so grateful, and became so much attached to his kind doctor, that he would not leave him, but stayed on in the monastery. Now, in this house no one, from the highest to the lowest, man or beast, was allowed to lead an idle life. It was not easy to find employment for a lion; but at length a daily task was found for him. This was to guard and watch over the ass, who each day carried in the firewood which was cut and gathered in the forest. The lion and ass became great friends, and no doubt the ass felt much comfort in having such a powerful protector. But it happened, on one very hot summer's day, that whilst the ass was at pasture the lion fell asleep. Some merchants were passing that way and seeing the ass grazing quietly, and apparently alone, they stole her and carried her off with them. In due time the lion awoke; but when he looked for the ass she was not to be seen. In vain he roamed about, seeking everywhere; he could not find her; and when evening came he had to return to the monastery alone, and with his head and tail drooping to show how ashamed he felt. As he could not speak to explain matters, St. Jerome feared that he had not been able to resist the temptation to eat raw flesh once more, and that he had devoured the poor ass. He therefore ordered that the lion should perform the daily task of his missing companion, and carry the firewood instead of her. The lion meekly submitted, and allowed the load of faggots to be tied on his back, and carried them safely home. As soon as he was unloaded he would run about for some time, still hoping to find the ass. One day, as he was hunting about in this fashion, he saw a caravan coming along with a string of camels. The camels, as was usual in some places, were led by an ass, and to the lion's joy he recognised his lost friend. He instantly fell on the caravan, and, without hurting any of the camels, succeeded in frightening them all so completely that he had no difficulty in driving them into the monastery where St. Jerome met them. The merchants, much alarmed, confessed their theft, and St. Jerome forgave them, and was very kind to them; but the ass, of course, returned to her former owners. And the lion was much petted and praised for his goodness and cleverness, and lived with St. Jerome till the end of his life.",0.12020173492628258,0.7202017349262826,-0.5,-0.1
