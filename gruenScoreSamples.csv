But he refused, and began to beat her and kick her from one end of the village to the other, singing merrily: If I could only open my door to an old woman and her cow, And give her an apron full of slops! But she hit him across the eyes with her fists, and gave him a kick ahead of her, which knocked him right over, and knocked out his teeth. Then she ran up the birch tree, crying out: If I could only open my door to an old woman and her cow, And give her an apron full of slops! Then the witch ran up the tree and met the wolf which had chased the carabao. ""And now, where are you going?"" cried the wolf. ""We have been doing a long journey for you. You must have lost your way. "" ""No,"" answered the wolf, ""we are here to relieve you if you need it. "" So he met the bear, and the bear began to whine and grumble. ""What is the matter with you? Why are you grumbling like this?"" asked the bear. ""Oh, Mr. Wolf, my granny called me a good boy, and told me to be quiet, and now I want to go into the woods and look for my fortune. "" And the wolf started up the birch tree and began to climb it. But the bear grabbed a stick and began to beat the wolf with it. Then the wolf fled screaming back up the tree. Then the wolf asked the bear, ""Is that the way you keep your promise?"" ""Yes,"" answered the bear. Back at home the child said to his mother, ""Oh, Mother, I know what you mean about the wolf. I will call him and tell him it is time for him to come. "" Then the mother was satisfied and let the bear come. The bear met the wolf in the woods. ""And what do you want, Brer Wolf?"" ""Do you want to hear about it, Brer Bear?"" said the wolf. ""The last time I heard that you were in the woods, and you told me to put my tail to the heat, I came and ate you up. That is the reason I am hungry today. But wait! I will go with you another time. When I see you I will try to bring you something to eat. Come out, Brer Wolf, or I will do you in. "" The wolf spoke, ""No, I cannot go out into the woods by myself. I cannot bare it. You know how it went last time. "" ""This time, however,"" said the bear, ""I will go with you. I have a hundred pounds lying at the bottom of my basket. You climb up into the basket and I will carry it to you. "" A bear would hear nothing of this. He was too proud. ""Yes, indeed,"" he said, ""you look as if you were afraid to look upon me. Let us put the question to yonder [that is, into the pond] over there. "" ""What is the question?"" asked the wolf. ""If you will let me satiate my thirst,"" said the bear. ""I need not lend you anything as long as you are on dry land,"" said the wolf. ""But you must be careful not to fall into the sea. "" That day the bear met an oldfish, and the oldfish thought nothing of the bear's proposal. That night the bear lay down beneath the tree and fell asleep. The wolf walked on until he came to the hollow tree. Seeing the bear there, he jumped up and knocked out its bark with his foot. Behold, the bear was there. The wolf asked, ""What is the matter with you? Where do you come from?"" ""Oh, my kind mistress sent me out to ask you to lend me a pot of water. "" The wolf gave him some. ""What are you going to do with it?"" asked the wolf. ""I am going to show it to your wife,"" replied the bear. So he took the pot on his back and, running as fast as he could, he",0,0,0,0

""Are you two making love in the grass? Did you break your vow? It would be a miracle if such a thing had happened. People would say the grasshopper was making love to the dragon's daughter. You should not make fun of people who are more pious than you. "" The housemaster brought in the dragon's daughter, and when she saw that everything prospered she began to believe that her old mother had come back to her. That evening she went out into the barn with the other rabbits and among the brannigans she met a handsome prince. To her he addressed, ""My brave man, do you know of anyone who might be able to help me with the sword?"" ""Certainly,"" answered the prince. Now he was herding his flocks, and they crossed the meadow. The maiden then threw herself on him and received a kiss. Morning approached, and the prince asked her if she had found the broom where she had been a princess. ""Yes,"" she said. ""I have found it, and with it I am pregnant. "" Now they could scarcely piece together how they had happened. The prince said to her, ""Do you have a son?"" ""Yes,"" she answered. ""Yes, I do have a son. He is just as red as myself and as white as an ordinary shirt. "" The prince looked at her carefully, but he could not succeed in guessing her fate. ""Do you think,"" asked he, ""I don't have another son? If so, I would like to know about him, for it would not be a stretch to think of him. "" ""Oh, no,"" she answered. ""I have but one son, and he is always sad, and my mam is very strict with him. "" But off he went to the king and told him how her companion had fared in the dragon's castle, and what he had heard there. Then the king held a large palaver of all the people, and the whole situation was discussed. A decision was reached that the younger princess should marry the young gentleman. The marriage was celebrated, and the news spread all over the world, so that now everyone wanted to be married. But the pig-boy, who had chased his sister around the world, wishing to become count and heir to untold wealth, came to his father and said, ""Sire, the daughter is to be married, but he wants to become her lord and marry her. Which would you prefer?"" The king made answer, ""My dear son, so be it!"" ""But,"" he said, ""would my wealth, which is enormous, lie?"" ""Of course,"" he replied. ""Well, then,"" asked the young man, ""what am I to do?"" ""Go and seek my brother, who lives in a distant town. He is a carpenter and has many wagons and carriages in his yard. He will help you a little. Place your mother in the carriage, and bring her to the town with you, for the bargain will be much more profitable to you than to her. "" The boy thanked his uncle and proceeded on his journey. He soon came to the town, and spoke to him and said, ""Good people, I want to seek my brother's fortune. Who is willing to give me his daughter in marriage?"" But the people of the town did not want to give in, and ordered him to go farther. He went out and followed the piper, who led him to a house. He looked inside and saw a large number of people enjoying themselves maylessly and the music was playing on all sides. ""Let's help ourselves to a good meal,"" said the boy, and he and his sister began to eat heartily.

The following year the wolf came again, and advised the cook to be more careful in the future, and to be sure when he cooked, he would take good care to get out a needle and thread both long and small. The cook was advised, and went on the next day and found a large toad lying in the middle of the cow pie. The toad had been there a long time tortured to death. They then went to church, and at the end of the mass, the cook came out from the church. ""Lord be merciful unto me, for I have brought you a toad,"" he said. The troll was now very near, and he said, ""Give me some meat. "" The cook replied, ""It will be hell to you, if you do not get some for yourself,"" and so he did. At the same time came another troll, who said, ""What will you have, cook?"" The cook said, ""More meat. I have been promised it. "" The troll was so angry that he jumped up and hit the cook on the back with his fist. ""Stupid fellow,"" he said, ""it was only a joke. "" They went to the high altar. The toad was a little larger than the witch, and he struck her hard with his paw. She cried out, ""May you be struck dead,"" and fled. The other trolls came and shouted at her, ""Throw the toad into the fire,"" but she threw it into the water and it ate it. Then she went to the oven, which was full of bread. She put the toad into the bread, and then stood it on its head. When it was dead, she threw it into the toad oven, and it ate it. Then she went to the tree that stood near the cow pie, and with one last blow cut it down. So the toad died, and she was free.",-5.800000000000001,-0.8,-1.2000000000000002,-16.7

The toad said to the weasel, ""Open your hole, so we can get our first glimpse of your beautiful legs. "" Then the weasel opened up, and they got a glimpse of the beautiful legs of the toad. The toad said, ""Be not afraid. Just come and lie down under my feet. "" So the toad laid down and went to sleep. Then the weasel came down and looked around to see if the toad was alive. He thought not, and he went back to the kitchen. While he was eating, he said, ""Wait for me outside your hole until I have eaten. "" Wait until he had eaten, and then the toad should appear. It happened, and the toad came. Then it shouted, ""I smell a man! I smell a woman approaching our hole. "" Then the toad laid down its head and tumed. The toad then laid down its head and tumed.
