At last the king ordered the guards to open the prison doors and let them go free; upon which the king command them to seize the soldier and to take him prisoner and put him in a prison ship mounted on high. Next day he ordered the coastguardsman to set sail with a grand cruize and to go around the world in search of the sea-beach. The whale-ship was put in sight of the king's palace, and the officer of the cruise was invited to go on deck. He steered the ship so close to the land that she began to quiver when the wind began to blow. The ship was soon in the king's harbour, and the cook sent to ask the reason of so great a delay. The king sent also to see whether the colonel of the fleet was here at the time, or if there was any news to relate. The colonel answered that there was a letter from the captain of a merchant which informed him that the queen had been afflicted with a poison against the sea, and that the only remedy was, to dress her head with a handkerchief. The king ordered the cook to dress the queen's head, and because it was so dirty, they threw it into the fire. She immediately recovered and told the king that she had heard that at the whar is the fair Queen of PÃ¶chlarsa, who is blind and deaf, and that every morning she asks her husband to send messengers to inquire if anything is the matter, and that she cannot well walk. The king sent another messenger to the merchant whom he had met at the water, and he also told him he had heard that the queen had been blind and deaf, and that it was the foolishness of the blind one over her that caused her this trouble. The king, after having asked him a number of questions about his business, returned to the subject, and ordered the queen to give an account of what she knew about the matter under the hand of the blind one. The queen swore that she knew nothing about it, and that her husband had told her that she had pressed the king to let her speak to him. The king ordered the queen to give an account of what she knew about the matter, and the queen filled out the declaration. The king ordered the queen to be blinded with a horn and told her to strike the woman who was standing before her with it, and she would see that what she perceived was the truth. The blind woman went to the king and told him everything, and he ordered the blind woman to be put to death. Now the king had a most powerful magician, and he took the confession from the queen and asked him to strike the blind woman dead with this instrument. The magician agreed, and the rope was DOTTED away, and the miscreant immediately vanished.",0.14028445886525953,0.749666573257296,0,0.22614199546250935
samples-111200,"The Priest's Supper There was once a man and a woman who had an only child, and it boils down to this: They were married, and they loved each other with all their hearts, but they hated each other's children. Now, you must know that this was a run of the luckiest luck that they could have known, and the more they hated each other's children, the worse it got. The road was long, and they wandered a long way over poor Old Nick's garden before they reached home. At last, they set off home again, and just as they were leaving he had something given to him, and he said, ""Nick a met a yeh! Ayeh! says he, ""Nick a g'en ye're g'ing han', ye're g'ing lose.

""Weeping makes us ill feeling, and we weep more than we rejoice!"" ""Yes,"" the preacher said, ""if you will follow my advice. You are now incharge of the cows. Find their millet, and when it is gathered, bring it to me on Friday. "" Then each one of them said, ""Related to your position, may I request a cup of milk immediately?"" The herdsman answered, ""Yes, give me a cup of milk!"" What could the other two do? If he wished for some milk, he must go to the herdsman. Some time later the herdsman came on a day when the demand for milk was greatest. He saw the other two and asked, ""Related to your position, may I request a cup of milk?"" ""Yes, give me a cup of milk!"" they answered. What could he do? The situation was serious. The sexton disappeared, and the farmer lost his land and his cattle.

samples-111300,"The Son Forgave His Father In olden times it was the custom in a certain town that when the master of the house became old his son had to take him away and drown him. A young man's father became old, and he said to his father, ""come with me. The time has come for you to be drowned. "" The poor old man followed along and was about to be drowned. His son said to him, ""Why are you afraid? I will save you. The time has come for you to be drowned. "" As his father did not refuse him, he obeyed. After getting old his father often remonstrated with him, saying, ""I shall not be able to earn one penny more, and you will lose all your merchandise. You should have been baptized in the baptisms of your ancestors. His son obeyed his father, and therefore had to perform such baptisms abroad. He baptized the bastard boys in the same manner as the legitimate children. Thus the children were taught to pray. Every day they went to pray in the churchyard. When the day came where they were to be drowned, the hyena boys appeared and asked: ""O father, are we to be drowned?"" ""Yes,"" said the father, ""if you will observe your commands. "" So the boys were drowned, but the hyena boys remained alive. When the boys' father saw that his children were still alive, he wanted to marry them. One day he sent one of the boys to run errands, and the boy returned saying that he had finished his errand. ""But,"" said the father, ""did I not tell you that it would be a sin and a great hindrance to your future happiness if you were to marry him? He is not a man of honor.
