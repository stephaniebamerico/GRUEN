The Wife in the Forest    A widow from the country with her six children was at one time very poor.  She made a will and left everything to each one of them.  All of the money she used to pay for a jug of milk or a piece of bread.     Now there was a very good farmer in the woods.  He asked them to give him a jug of milk or a bread, and they said to agree to this. Then the man took a basketful of the milk or the bread he wanted, and gave it to the wife.      Then the farmer began to tell them that it was not what her husband had promised, and as soon as he would not make the promise he took the money that they had promised him and ran.
