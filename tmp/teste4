The Girl and the Goose    Two friends, one on the right hand and the other on the    left, were sitting at the feast with the goose, and the duck on top    of it. One said to the goose: 'What do you want?'    The goose said: 'To be kissed' and the other said:     'A goose and a duck's feathers for your shoes.'
